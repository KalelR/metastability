Good:
Neuroscience
- Giancarlo La Camera: important work on metastability, published in Plos Comp Bio this year (2023); has the recent review on metastability also; if not him also Braden A. W. Brinkman (co-worker) 
- Mikhail Rabinovich: work on heteroclinic cycles/metastability; published in plos comp bio  
- Valentin Afraimovich: work on heteroclinic cycles/metastability; published in plos comp bio 
- Scott Kelso: a lot of works on metastability; we complement/extend his views
Dynamics:
- Peter Ashwin: very good researcher in dynamics, work on heteroclinic cycles and transients 

Unsure:
- Fingelkurts: lot of works on metastability, no clue about them though
- Karl Friston: we agree a lot, but he might just be too busy

Probably bad:
Steven schiff: seemed to like the work, but not very related
Gustavo deco: I'd avoid, since their group is pretty much the only that we disagree with; what about Viktor Jirsa and Morten Kringelbach?
Hastings: understands transients, but not very strong in neuro or dynamics
Tsuda and Kaneko: better not I think
