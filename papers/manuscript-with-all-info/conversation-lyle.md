Pleasure to meet so

As you probably know, I and Roberto are relatively new to neuroscience in general, as our background is in physics and nonlinear dynamics. So we might miss or not know some important details that are basic to someone with a formation in the field, though I hope not haha. But one nice perk of being from a different field is that we might notice or view things in different ways. This is related to what I wanted to talk to you about. We learned about metastability in neuroscience and became very interested in it. Upon reading some of the basic and more well-read papers talking about it, we notice that this term is rather loosely defined.

Papers define it in different ways. Though these different definitions may be consistent, it is important, we think, to discuss this clearly. This is the first point I'd like to talk to you about. See what you think about what we want to discuss and the relevance of doing that.  Would that be ok with you?

I have read some papers discussing the term, and measuring it, and classified the way they define metastability, explicity or implicitly. TABELA
