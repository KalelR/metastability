abstract = {We investigate the synchronization features of a network of spiking neurons under a distance-dependent coupling following a power-law model. The interplay between topology and coupling strength leads to the existence of different spatiotemporal patterns, corresponding to either non-synchronized or phase-synchronized states. Particularly interesting is what we call synchronization malleability, in which the system depicts significantly different phase synchronization degrees for the same parameters as a consequence of a different ordering of neural inputs. We analyze the functional connectivity of the network by calculating the mutual information between neuronal spike trains, allowing us to characterize the structures of synchronization in the network. We show that these structures are dependent on the ordering of the inputs for the parameter regions where the network presents synchronization malleability and we suggest that this is due to a balance between local and global effects.},

abstract = {The number of different cortical structures in mammalian brains and the number of extrinsic fibres linking these regions are both large. As with any complex system, systematic analysis is required to draw reliable conclusions about the organization of the complex neural networks comprising these numerous elements. One aspect of organization that has long been suspected is that cortical networks are organized into 'streams' or 'systems'. Here we report computational analyses capable of showing whether clusters of strongly interconnected areas are aspects of the global organization of cortical systems in macaque and cat. We used two different approaches to analyse compilations of corticocortical connection data from the macaque and the cat. The first approach, optimal set analysis, employed an explicit definition of a neural 'system' or 'stream', which was based on differential connectivity. We defined a two-component cost function that described the cost of the global cluster arrangement of areas in terms of the areas' connectivity within and between candidate clusters. Optimal cluster arrangements of cortical areas were then selected computationally from the very many possible arrangements, using an evolutionary optimization algorithm. The second approach, non-parametric cluster analysis ({\{}NPCA{\}}), grouped cortical areas on the basis of their proximity in multidimensional scaling representations. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling to represent the cortical connectivity structures metrically in two and five dimensions. {\{}NPCA{\}} then analysed these representations to determine the nature of the clusters for a wide range of different cluster shape parameters. The results from both approaches largely agreed. They showed that macaque and cat cortices are organized into densely intra-connected clusters of areas, and identified the constituent members of the clusters. These clusters reflected functionally specialized sets of cortical areas, suggesting that structure and function are closely linked at this gross, systems level.},

abstract = {Traveling patterns of neuronal activity-brain waves-have been observed across a breadth of neuronal recordings, states of awareness, and species, but their emergence in the human brain lacks a firm understanding. Here we analyze the complex nonlinear dynamics that emerge from modeling large-scale spontaneous neural activity on a whole-brain network derived from human tractography. We find a rich array of three-dimensional wave patterns, including traveling waves, spiral waves, sources, and sinks. These patterns are metastable, such that multiple spatiotemporal wave patterns are visited in sequence. Transitions between states correspond to reconfigurations of underlying phase flows, characterized by nonlinear instabilities. These metastable dynamics accord with empirical data from multiple imaging modalities, including electrical waves in cortical tissue, sequential spatiotemporal patterns in resting-state {\{}MEG{\}} data, and large-scale waves in human electrocorticography. By moving the study of functional networks from a spatially static to an inherently dynamic (wave-like) frame, our work unifies apparently diverse phenomena across functional neuroimaging modalities and makes specific predictions for further experimentation.},

abstract = {Noise driven exploration of a brain network's dynamic repertoire has been hypothesized to be causally involved in cognitive function, aging and neurodegeneration. The dynamic repertoire crucially depends on the network's capacity to store patterns, as well as their stability. Here we systematically explore the capacity of networks derived from human connectomes to store attractor states, as well as various network mechanisms to control the brain's dynamic repertoire. Using a deterministic graded response Hopfield model with connectome-based interactions, we reconstruct the system's attractor space through a uniform sampling of the initial conditions. Large fixed-point attractor sets are obtained in the low temperature condition, with a bigger number of attractors than ever reported so far. Different variants of the initial model, including (i) a uniform activation threshold or (ii) a global negative feedback, produce a similarly robust multistability in a limited parameter range. A numerical analysis of the distribution of the attractors identifies spatially-segregated components , with a centro-medial core and several well-delineated regional patches. Those different modes share similarity with the fMRI independent components observed in the "resting state" condition. We demonstrate non-stationary behavior in noise-driven generalizations of the models, with different meta-stable attractors visited along the same time course. Only the model with a global dynamic density control is found to display robust and long-lasting non-stationarity with no tendency toward either overactivity or extinction. The best fit with empirical signals is observed at the edge of multistability, a parameter region that also corresponds to the highest entropy of the attractors. Author Summary Recent developments in non-invasive brain imaging allow reconstructing axonal tracts in the human brain and building realistic network models of the human brain. These models resemble brain systems in their network character and allow deciphering how different regions share signals and process information. Inspired by the metastable dynamics of the spin glass model in statistical physics, we systematically explore the brain network's capacity to process information and investigate novel avenues how to enhance it. In particular, we study how the brain activates and switches between different functional networks PLOS Computational Biology |},

abstract = {How random is the discharge pattern of cortical neurons? We examined recordings from primary visual cortex (V1; Knierim and Van Essen, 1992) and extrastriate cortex ({\{}MT{\}}; Newsome et al., 1989a) of awake, behaving macaque monkey and compared them to analytical predictions. For nonbursting cells firing at sustained rates up to 300 Hz, we evaluated two indices of firing variability: the ratio of the variance to the mean for the number of action potentials evoked by a constant stimulus, and the rate-normalized coefficient of variation (Cv) of the interspike interval distribution. Firing in virtually all V1 and {\{}MT{\}} neurons was nearly consistent with a completely random process (e.g., Cv approximately 1). We tried to model this high variability by small, independent, and random {\{}EPSPs{\}} converging onto a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron (Knight, 1972). Both this and related models predicted very low firing variability (Cv {\textless}1) for realistic {\{}EPSP{\}} depolarizations and membrane time constants. We also simulated a biophysically very detailed compartmental model of an anatomically reconstructed and physiologically characterized layer V cat pyramidal cell (Douglas et al., 1991) with passive dendrites and active soma. If independent, excitatory synaptic input fired the model cell at the high rates observed in monkey, the Cv and the variability in the number of spikes were both very low, in agreement with the integrate-and-fire models but in strong disagreement with the majority of our monkey data. The simulated cell only produced highly variable firing when Hodgkin-Huxley-like currents ({\{}INa{\}} and very strong {\{}IDR{\}}) were placed on distal dendrites. Now the simulated neuron acted more as a millisecond-resolution detector of dendritic spike coincidences than as a temporal integrator. We argue that neurons that act as temporal integrators over many synaptic inputs must fire very regularly. Only in the presence of either fast and strong dendritic nonlinearities or strong synchronization among individual synaptic events will the degree of predicted variability approach that of real cortical neurons.},

Suppression of these synchronized rhythms has potential implications in electrical deep-brain stimulation research. We consider a simplified model of a neuronal network where the local dynamics presents a bursting timescale, and the connection architecture displays the scale-free property (power-law distribution of connectivity). The networks exhibit collective oscillations in the form of synchronized bursting rhythms, without affecting the fast timescale dynamics. We investigate the suppression of these synchronized oscillations using a feedback control in the form of a time-delayed signal. We located domains of bursting synchronization suppression in terms of perturbation strength and time delay, and present computational evidence that synchronization suppression is easier in scale-free networks than in the more commonly studied global (mean-field) networks.},

We distinguish two types of susceptibilities: vertex susceptibilities and edge susceptibilities, measuring the responses due to changes in the properties of units and their interactions, respectively. We derive explicit forms of network susceptibilities for oscillator networks close to steady states and offer example applications for Kuramoto-type phase-oscillator models, power grid models, and generic flow models. Focusing on the role of the network topology implies that these ideas can be easily generalized to other types of networks, in particular those characterizing flow, transport, or spreading phenomena. The concept of network susceptibilities is broadly applicable and may straightforwardly be transferred to all settings where networks responses of the collective dynamics to topological changes are essential.},

abstract = {Autism is often described as a disorder of neural synchronization. However, it is unknown how early in development synchronization abnormalities emerge and whether they are related to the development of early autistic behavioral symptoms. Here, we show that disrupted synchronization is evident in the spontaneous cortical activity of naturally sleeping toddlers with autism, but not in toddlers with language delay or typical development. Toddlers with autism exhibited significantly weaker interhemispheric synchronization (i.e., weak "functional connectivity" across the two hemispheres) in putative language areas. The strength of synchronization was positively correlated with verbal ability and negatively correlated with autism severity, and it enabled identification of the majority of autistic toddlers (72{\%}) with high accuracy (84{\%}). Disrupted cortical synchronization, therefore, appears to be a notable characteristic of autism neurophysiology that is evident at very early stages of autism development.

From elementary coordination dynamics we show explicitly that metastability is a result of a symmetry breaking caused by the subtle interplay of two forces: the tendency of the components to couple together and the tendency of the components to express their intrinsic independent behavior. The metastable regime reconciles the well-known tendencies of specialized brain regions to express their autonomy (segregation) and the tendencies for those regions to work together as a synergy (integration). Integration ∼ segregation is just one of the complementary pairs (denoted by the tilde (∼) symbol) to emerge from the science of coordination dynamics.

In both cases, the recursively reentrant activity flow in intra-cortical and cortical-subcortical neuron loops plays an essential and distinct role. Reasons will be given for viewing the temporal characteristics of this activity flow as signature of self-organized criticality (SOC), notably in reference to the dynamics of neuronal avalanches.

abstract = {Spatial patterns of coherent activity across different brain areas have been identified during the resting-state fluctuations of the brain. However, recent studies indicate that resting-state activity is not stationary, but shows complex temporal dynamics. We were interested in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the phase interactions among resting-state fMRI BOLD signals from human subjects. We found that the global phase synchrony of the BOLD signals evolves on a characteristic ultra-slow ({\textless}0.01Hz) time scale, and that its temporal variations reflect the transient formation and dissolution of multiple communities of synchronized brain regions. Synchronized communities reoccurred intermittently in time and across scanning sessions. We found that the synchronization communities relate to previously defined functional networks known to be engaged in sensory-motor or cognitive function, called resting-state networks (RSNs), including the default mode network, the somato-motor network, the visual network, the auditory network, the cognitive control networks, the self-referential network, and combinations of these and other RSNs. We studied the mechanism originating the observed spatiotemporal synchronization dynamics by using a network model of phase oscillators connected through the brain's anatomical connectivity estimated using diffusion imaging human data. The model consistently approximates the temporal and spatial synchronization patterns of the empirical data, and reveals that multiple clusters that transiently synchronize and desynchronize emerge from the complex topology of anatomical connections, provided that oscillators are heterogeneous.},

abstract = {The generation of high-frequency spike bursts ("complex spikes"), either spontaneously or in response to depolarizing stimuli applied to the soma, is a notable feature in intracellular recordings from hippocampal {\{}CA1{\}} pyramidal cells ({\{}PCs{\}}) in vivo. There is compelling evidence that the bursts are intrinsically generated by summation of large spike afterdepolarizations ({\{}ADPs{\}}). Using intracellular recordings in adult rat hippocampal slices, we show that intrinsic burst-firing in {\{}CA1{\}} {\{}PCs{\}} is strongly dependent on the extracellular concentration of Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](o)). Thus, lowering [Ca(2+)](o) (by equimolar substitution with Mn(2+) or Mg(2+)) induced intrinsic bursting in nonbursters, whereas raising [Ca(2+)](o) suppressed intrinsic bursting in native bursters. The induction of intrinsic bursting by low [Ca(2+)](o) was associated with enlargement of the spike {\{}ADP{\}}. Low [Ca(2+)](o)-induced intrinsic bursts and their underlying {\{}ADPs{\}} were suppressed by drugs that reduce the persistent Na(+) current (I({\{}NaP{\}})), indicating that this current mediates the slow burst depolarization. Blocking Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents with extracellular Ni(2+) or intracellular chelation of Ca(2+) did not induce intrinsic bursting. This and other evidence suggest that lowering [Ca(2+)](o) may induce intrinsic bursting by augmenting I({\{}NaP{\}}). Because repetitive neuronal activity in the hippocampus is associated with marked decreases in [Ca(2+)](o), the regulation of intrinsic bursting by extracellular Ca(2+) may provide a mechanism for preferential recruitment of this firing mode during certain forms of hippocampal activation.},

abstract = {How do we keep an object in mind? Based on evidence from animal electrophysiology and human brain-imaging techniques, it is commonly held that short-term memory relies on sustained activity in a network distributed over sensory and prefrontal cortices. How does neural firing persist in such a distributed network in the absence of visual input? Hebb's influential but so far unproved proposal, developed more than 50 years ago, is that sustained activation in short-term memory networks is maintained by reverberating activity in neuronal loops. We hypothesized that synchronized oscillatory activity, proposed to provide a dynamic link between distributed areas, could not only coordinate activity in the network but also establish reentrant loops in the system to enable both sustained firing and temporal coincidence of inputs. We show in human intracranial recordings that limited regions of extrastriate visual areas, separated by several centimeters, become synchronized in an oscillatory mode during the rehearsal of an object in visual short-term memory. Synchrony occurs specifically in the beta range (15-25 Hz) and disappears in a control condition. These findings thus confirm experimentally the hypothesis of a functional role of synchronized oscillatory activity in the coordination of distributed neural activity in humans, and support Hebb's popular but unproved concept of short-term memory maintenance by reentrant activity within the activated network.},

abstract = {Spontaneous afferent activity was recorded from 26 single ampullary electroreceptive organs of freshwater catfish (Ictalurus nebulosus {\{}LeS{\}}) at various temperatures. Regular grouping of action potentials was apparent in this secondary sensory system at 35 degrees C and occasionally at 30 degrees C. Impulse groups consisted of up to seven impulses. The precise timing of impulse generation and the temporal sequence of impulses indicated that oscillating processes are involved. Expectation density functions were calculated for records of afferent activity obtained at various temperatures below 35 degrees C. In the majority of records the function was periodic. Impulse grouping and expectation density functions became more distinct in units exhibiting extremely high thresholds (i.e. being insensitive) to electrical stimuli. The results suggest that the oscillations originate from the postsynaptic membrane. The temporal pattern of impulse generation within impulse groups of ampullary electroreceptor organs and of specific warm and cold receptors was compared and found to be similar. Application of cadmium and menthol, which both reduce calcium entry, suppressed spontaneous activity in normal and insensitive electroreceptor systems, attenuated the sensitivity of normal receptors and modified the periodic pattern. This indicates that calcium is implicated in sensory transduction and in postsynaptic mechanisms. The data suggest that an oscillating process is one component of signal transmission in ampullary electroreceptor organs of teleost fish.},

abstract = {Synchronization or phase-locking between oscillating neuronal groups is considered to be important for coordination of information among cortical networks. Spectral coherence is a commonly used approach to quantify phase locking between neural signals. We systematically explored the validity of spectral coherence measures for quantifying synchronization among neural oscillators. To that aim, we simulated coupled oscillatory signals that exhibited synchronization dynamics using an abstract phase-oscillator model as well as interacting gamma-generating spiking neural networks. We found that, within a large parameter range, the spectral coherence measure deviated substantially from the expected phase-locking. Moreover, spectral coherence did not converge to the expected value with increasing signal-to-noise ratio. We found that spectral coherence particularly failed when oscillators were in the partially (intermittent) synchronized state, which we expect to be the most likely state for neural synchronization. The failure was due to the fast frequency and amplitude changes induced by synchronization forces. We then investigated whether spectral coherence reflected the information flow among networks measured by transfer entropy ({\{}TE{\}}) of spike trains. We found that spectral coherence failed to robustly reflect changes in synchrony-mediated information flow between neural networks in many instances. As an alternative approach we explored a phase-locking value ({\{}PLV{\}}) method based on the reconstruction of the instantaneous phase. As one approach for reconstructing instantaneous phase, we used the Hilbert Transform ({\{}HT{\}}) preceded by Singular Spectrum Decomposition ({\{}$\backslash$SSD{\}}) of the signal. {\{}PLV{\}} estimates have broad applicability as they do not rely on stationarity, and, unlike spectral coherence, they enable more accurate estimations of oscillatory synchronization across a wide range of different synchronization regimes, and better tracking of synchronization-mediated information flow among networks.},

abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

abstract = {The dynamics of the environment where we live in and the interaction with it, predicting events, provided strong evolutionary pressures for the brain functioning to process temporal information and generate timed responses. As a result, the human brain is able to process temporal information and generate temporal patterns. Despite the clear importance of temporal processing to cognition, learning, communication and sensory, motor and emotional processing, the basal mechanisms of how animals differentiate simple intervals or provide timed responses are still under debate. The lesson we learned from the last decade of research in neuroscience is that functional and structural brain connectivity matter. Specifically, it has been accepted that the organization of the brain in interacting segregated networks enables its function. In this paper we delineate the route to a promising approach for investigating timing mechanisms. We illustrate how novel insight into timing mechanisms can come by investigating brain functioning as a multi-layer dynamical network whose clustered dynamics is bound to report the presence of metastable states. We anticipate that metastable dynamics underlie the real-time coordination necessary for the brain's dynamic functioning associated to time perception. This new point of view will help further clarifying mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

However, the mechanisms responsible for the effects of expectation on sensory circuits remain elusive. In the present study, we report a novel computational mechanism underlying the expectation-dependent acceleration of coding observed in the gustatory cortex of alert rats. We use a recurrent spiking network model with a clustered architecture capturing essential features of cortical activity, such as its intrinsically generated metastable dynamics. Relying on network theory and computer simulations, we propose that expectation exerts its function by modulating the intrinsically generated dynamics preceding taste delivery. Our model's predictions were confirmed in the experimental data, demonstrating how the modulation of ongoing activity can shape sensory coding. Altogether, these results provide a biologically plausible theory of expectation and ascribe an alternative functional role to intrinsically generated, metastable activity.},

abstract = {In this, the first of three papers, the nature of, and motivation for, neuronal transients is described in relation to characterizing brain dynamics. This paper deals with some basic aspects of neuronal dynamics, interactions, coupling and implicit neuronal codes. The second paper develops neuronal transients and nonlinear coupling in the context of dynamic instability and complexity, and suggests that instability or lability is necessary for adaptive self-organization. The final paper addresses the role of neuronal transients through information theory and the emergence of spatio-temporal receptive fields and functional specialization. By considering the brain as an ensemble of connected dynamic systems one can show that a sufficient description of neuronal dynamics comprises neuronal activity at a particular time and its recent history This history constitutes a neuronal transient. As such, transients represent a fundamental metric of neuronal interactions and, implicitly, a code employed in the functional integration of brain systems. The nature of transients, expressed conjointly in distinct neuronal populations, reflects the underlying coupling among populations. This coupling may be synchronous (and possibly oscillatory) or asynchronous. A critical distinction between synchronous and asynchronous coupling is that the former is essentially linear and the latter is nonlinear. The nonlinear nature of asynchronous coupling enables the rich, context-sensitive interactions that characterize real brain dynamics, suggesting that it plays a role in functional integration that may be as important as synchronous interactions. The distinction between linear and nonlinear coupling has fundamental implications for the analysis and characterization of neuronal interactions, most of which are predicated on linear (synchronous) coupling (e.g. cross-correlograms and coherence). Using neuromagnetic data it is shown that nonlinear (asynchronous) coupling is, in fact, more abundant and can be more significant than synchronous coupling.},

While this effect is well known, the impact of channel noise on single neuron dynamics remains poorly understood. Most results are based on numerical simulations. There is no agreement, even in theoretical studies, on which ion channel type is the dominant noise source, nor how inclusion of additional ion channel types affects voltage noise.

We find the states at which the perturbation desynchronizes the network to be complicatedly mixed with the ones that restore synchronization. Additionally, we characterize perturbation sets obtained for consecutive states by defining a safety index between them.

abstract = {Macroscopic (millimeter scale) functional clustering is a hallmark characteristic of motor cortex spatial organization in awake behaving mammals; however, almost no information is known about the functional micro-organization (∼100 $\mu$m scale). Here, we optically recorded intracellular calcium transients of layer 2/3 neurons with cellular resolution over ∼200-$\mu$m-diameter fields in the forelimb motor cortex of mobile, head-restrained mice during two distinct movements (running and grooming). We showed that the temporal correlation between neurons was statistically larger the closer the neurons were to each other. We further explored this correlation by using two separate methods to spatially segment the neurons within each imaging field: K-means clustering and correlations between single neuron activity and mouse movements. The two methods segmented the neurons similarly and led to the conclusion that the origin of the inverse relationship between correlation and distance seen statistically was twofold: clusters of highly temporally correlated neurons were often spatially distinct from one another, and (even when the clusters were spatially intermingled) within the clusters, the more correlated the neurons were to each other, the shorter the distance between them.

abstract = {We investigate the basin of attraction properties and its boundaries for chimera states in a circulant network of H{\'{e}}non maps. It is known that coexisting basins of attraction lead to a hysteretic behaviour in the diagrams of the density of states as a function of a varying parameter. Chimera states, for which coherent and incoherent domains occur simultaneously, emerge as a consequence of the coexistence of basin of attractions for each state. Consequently, the distribution of chimera states can remain invariant by a parameter change, and it can also suffer subtle changes when one of the basins ceases to exist. A similar phenomenon is observed when perturbations are applied in the initial conditions. By means of the uncertainty exponent, we characterise the basin boundaries between the coherent and chimera states, and between the incoherent and chimera states. This way, we show that the density of chimera states can be not only moderately sensitive but also highly sensitive to initial conditions. This chimera's dilemma is a consequence of the fractal and riddled nature of the basin boundaries.},

When an acoustic stimulus frequency is changed systematically, a spontaneous transition in coordination occurs at a critical frequency in both motor behavior and brain signals. Qualitatively analogous transitions are known for physical and biological systems such as changes in the coordination of human hand movements (Kelso 1981, 1984). In this paper we develop a theoretical model based on methods from the interdisciplinary field of synergetics (Haken 1983, 1987) and nonlinear oscillator theory that reproduces the main experimental features very well and suggests a formulation of a fundamental biophysical coupling.},

abstract = {Humans navigate across a range of spatial scales, from rooms to continents, but the brain systems underlying spatial cognition are usually investigated only in small-scale environments. Do the same brain systems represent and process larger spaces? Here we asked subjects to compare distances between real-world items at six different spatial scales (room, building, neighborhood, city, country, continent) under functional MRI. Cortical activity showed a gradual progression from small to large scale processing, along three gradients extending anteriorly from the parahippocampal place area (PPA), retrosplenial complex (RSC) and occipital place area (OPA), and along the hippocampus posterior-anterior axis. Each of the cortical gradients overlapped with the visual system posteriorly and the default-mode network (DMN) anteriorly. These results suggest a progression from concrete to abstract processing with increasing spatial scale, and offer a new organizational framework for the brain's spatial system, that may also apply to conceptual spaces beyond the spatial domain.},

Moreover, multistability spans (at least) the domains of action and perception, and has been found to place constraints upon, even dictating the nature of, intentional change and the skill-learning process. This paper reviews some of the key evidence for multistability in the aforementioned areas, and illustrates how it has been measured, modelled and theoretically understood. It then suggests how multistability- when combined with essential aspects of coordination dynamics such as instability, transitions and (especially) metastability-provides a platform for understanding coupling and the creative dynamics of complex goal-directed systems, including the brain and the brain-behaviour relation. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Many researchers and clinicians in cognitive neuroscience hold to a modular view of cognitive function in which the cerebral cortex operates by the activation of areas with circumscribed elementary cognitive functions. Yet an ongoing paradigm shift to a dynamic network perspective is underway. This new viewpoint treats cortical function as arising from the coordination dynamics within and between cortical regions. Cortical coordination dynamics arises due to the unidirectional influences imposed on a cortical area by inputs from other areas that project to it, combined with the projection reciprocity that characterizes cortical connectivity and gives rise to reentrant processing. As a result, cortical dynamics exhibits both segregative and integrative tendencies and gives rise to both cooperative and competitive relations within and between cortical areas that are hypothesized to underlie the emergence of cognition in brains.},

abstract = {To facilitate the characterization of cortical neuronal function, the responses of cells in cat area 17 to intracellular injection of current pulses were quantitatively analyzed. A variety of response variables were used to separate the cells into subtypes using cluster analysis. Four main classes of neurons could be clearly distinguished: regular spiking ({\{}RS{\}}), fast spiking ({\{}FS{\}}), intrinsic bursting ({\{}IB{\}}), and chattering ({\{}CH{\}}). Each of these contained significant subclasses. {\{}RS{\}} neurons were characterized by trains of action potentials that exhibited spike frequency adaptation. Morphologically, these cells were spiny stellate cells in layer 4 and pyramidal cells in layers 2, 3, 5, and 6. {\{}FS{\}} neurons had short-duration action potentials ({\textless}0.5 ms at half height), little or no spike frequency adaptation, and a steep relationship between injected current intensity and spike discharge frequency. Morphologically, these cells were sparsely spiny or aspiny nonpyramidal cells. {\{}IB{\}} neurons typically generated a low frequency ({\textless}425 Hz) burst of spikes at the beginning of a depolarizing current pulse followed by a tonic train of action potentials for the remainder of the pulse. These cells were observed in all cortical layers, but were most abundant in layer 5. Finally, {\{}CH{\}} neurons generated repetitive, high-frequency (350-700 Hz) bursts of short-duration ({\textless}0.55 ms) action potentials. Morphologically, these cells were layer 2-4 (mainly layer 3) pyramidal or spiny stellate neurons. These results indicate that firing properties do not form a continuum and that cortical neurons are members of distinct electrophysiological classes and subclasses.},

abstract = {Human learning is a complex phenomenon requiring flexibility to adapt existing brain function and precision in selecting new neurophysiological activities to drive desired behavior. These two attributes - flexibility and selection - must operate over multiple temporal scales as performance of a skill changes from being slow and challenging to being fast and automatic. Such selective adaptability is naturally provided by modular structure, which plays a critical role in evolution, development, and optimal network function. Using functional connectivity measurements of brain activity acquired from initial training through mastery of a simple motor skill, we investigate the role of modularity in human learning by identifying dynamic changes of modular organization spanning multiple temporal scales. Our results indicate that flexibility, which we measure by the allegiance of nodes to modules, in one experimental session predicts the relative amount of learning in a future session. We also develop a general statistical framework for the identification of modular architectures in evolving systems, which is broadly applicable to disciplines where network adaptability is crucial to the understanding of system performance.},

abstract = {Encoding of visual information by {\{}LGN{\}} bursts. Thalamic relay cells respond to visual stimuli either in burst mode, as a result of activation of a low-threshold Ca2+ conductance, or in tonic mode, when this conductance is inactive. We investigated the role of these two response modes for the encoding of the time course of dynamic visual stimuli, based on extracellular recordings of 35 relay cells from the lateral geniculate nucleus of anesthetized cats. We presented a spatially optimized visual stimulus whose contrast fluctuated randomly in time with frequencies of up to 32 Hz. We estimated the visual information in the neural responses using a linear stimulus reconstruction method. Both burst and tonic spikes carried information about stimulus contrast, exceeding one bit per action potential for the highest variance stimuli. The "meaning" of an action potential, i.e., the optimal estimate of the stimulus at times preceding a spike, was similar for burst and tonic spikes. In within-trial comparisons, tonic spikes carried about twice as much information per action potential as bursts, but bursts as unitary events encoded about three times more information per event than tonic spikes. The coding efficiency of a neuron for a particular stimulus is defined as the fraction of the neural coding capacity that carries stimulus information. Based on a lower bound estimate of coding efficiency, bursts had approximately 1.5-fold higher efficiency than tonic spikes, or 3-fold if bursts were considered unitary events. Our main conclusion is that both bursts and tonic spikes encode stimulus information efficiently, which rules out the hypothesis that bursts are nonvisual responses.},

In general, the variance of a neuron's firing rate is directly proportional to its mean firing rate. The probability that a neuron will fire a criterion number of impulses on a stimulus trial grows monotonically with the contrast of a sinusoidal grating stimulus. Neural probability functions prepared either by computing the probability of criterion response or by integrating receiver operating characteristics to yield the probability of correct choice in a two-alternative forced-choice situation resemble psychometric functions obtained in psychophysical and behavioral experiments on humans and animals, but are shallower in slope. The slopes of neuronal probability functions are slightly higher when they are estimated over short time periods, but even so do not equal the slopes measured psychophysically in human and monkey observers. This discrepancy in slope could be explained if the whole observer responded only when about four neurons were active together.},

abstract = {Groups of neurons firing synchronously are hypothesized to underlie many cognitive functions such as attention, associative learning, memory, and sensory selection. Recent theories suggest that transient periods of synchronization and desynchronization provide a mechanism for dynamically integrating and forming coalitions of functionally related neural areas, and that at these times conditions are optimal for information transfer. Oscillating neural populations display a great amount of spectral complexity, with several rhythms temporally coexisting in different structures and interacting with each other. This paper explores inter-band frequency modulation between neural oscillators using models of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons and Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. We vary the structural connectivity in a network of neural oscillators, assess the spectral complexity, and correlate the inter-band frequency modulation. We contrast this correlation against measures of metastable coalition entropy and synchrony. Our results show that oscillations in different neural populations modulate each other so as to change frequency, and that the interaction of these fluctuating frequencies in the network as a whole is able to drive different neural populations towards episodes of synchrony. Further to this, we locate an area in the connectivity space in which the system directs itself in this way so as to explore a large repertoire of synchronous coalitions. We suggest that such dynamics facilitate versatile exploration, integration, and communication between functionally related neural areas, and thereby supports sophisticated cognitive processing in the brain. {\textcopyright} 2013 Bhowmik, Shanahan.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the small-world network model of Watts and Strogatz, which mimics some aspects of the structure of networks of social interactions. We argue that there is one nontrivial length-scale in the model, analogous to the correlation length in other systems, which is well-defined in the limit of infinite system size and which diverges continuously as the randomness in the network tends to zero, giving a normal critical point in this limit. This length-scale governs the crossover from large- to small-world behavior in the model, as well as the number of vertices in a neighborhood of given radius on the network. We derive the value of the single critical exponent controlling behavior in the critical region and the finite size scaling form for the average vertex-vertex distance on the network, and, using series expansion and Pad{\'{e}} approximants, find an approximate analytic form for the scaling function. We calculate the effective dimension of small-world graphs and show that this dimension varies as a function of the length-scale on which it is measured, in a manner reminiscent of multifractals. We also study the problem of site percolation on small-world networks as a simple model of disease propagation, and derive an approximate expression for the percolation probability at which a giant component of connected vertices first forms (in epidemiological terms, the point at which an epidemic occurs). The typical cluster radius satisfies the expected finite size scaling form with a cluster size exponent close to that for a random graph. All our analytic results are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations of the model.},

RSNs are characterized by their functional connectivity in terms of within-network cohesion and between-network integration, and by their dynamic properties in terms of synchrony and metastability. We examined the relationship between functional connectivity and dynamic network features using fMRI data and an anatomically constrained Kuramoto model. Extrapolating from simulated data, synchrony and metastability across the RSNs emerged at coupling strengths of 5 ≤ k ≤ 12. In the empirical RSNs, higher metastability and synchrony were respectively associated with greater cohesion and lower integration. Consistent with their dual role in supporting both sustained and diverse mental operations, higher-order RSNs had lower metastability and synchrony. Sensory and motor RSNs showed greater cohesion and metastability, likely to respectively reflect their functional specialization and their greater capacity for altering network states in response to multiple and diverse external demands. Our findings suggest that functional and dynamic RSN properties are closely linked and expand our understanding of the neural architectures that support optimal brain function.},

Evidence that cortical neural activity unfolds as a sequence of metastable states is accumulating at fast pace. Metastable activity occurs both in response to an external stimulus and during ongoing, self-generated activity. These spontaneous metastable states are increasingly found to subserve internal representations that are not locked to external triggers, including states of deliberations, attention and expectation. Moreover, decoding stimuli or decisions via metastable states can be carried out trial-by-trial. Focusing on metastability will allow us to shift our perspective on neural coding from traditional concepts based on trial-averaging to models based on dynamic ensemble representations. Recent theoretical work has started to characterize the mechanistic origin and potential roles of metastable representations. In this article we review recent findings on metastable activity, how it may arise in biologically realistic models, and its potential role for representing internal states as well as relevant task variables.},

abstract = {The human brain is functionally organized into large-scale neural networks that are dynamically interconnected. Multiple short-lived states of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) identified transiently synchronized networks and cross-network integration. However, little is known about the way brain couplings covary as rsFC states wax and wane. In this magnetoencephalography study, we explore the synchronization structure among the spontaneous interactions of well-known resting-state networks (RSNs). To do so, we extracted modes of dynamic coupling that reflect rsFC synchrony and analyzed their spatio-temporal features. These modes identified transient, sporadic rsFC changes characterized by the widespread integration of RSNs across the brain, most prominently in the $\beta$ band. This is in line with the metastable rsFC state model of resting-state dynamics, wherein our modes fit as state transition processes. Furthermore, the default-mode network (DMN) stood out as being structured into competitive cross-network couplings with widespread DMN-RSN interactions, especially among the $\beta$-band modes. These results substantiate the theory that the DMN is a core network enabling dynamic global brain integration in the $\beta$ band.},

abstract = {Despite resting state networks being associated with a variety of cognitive abilities, it remains unclear how these local areas act in concert to express particular cognitive operations. Theoretical and empirical accounts indicate that large-scale resting state networks reconcile dual tendencies towards integration and segregation by operating in a metastable regime of their coordination dynamics. Metastability may confer important behavioural qualities by binding distributed local areas into large-scale neurocognitive networks. We tested this hypothesis by analysing fMRI data in a large cohort of healthy individuals (N = 566) and comparing the metastability of the brain's large-scale resting network architecture at rest and during the performance of several tasks. Metastability was estimated using a well-defined collective variable capturing the level of 'phase-locking' between large-scale networks over time. Task-based reasoning was principally characterised by high metastability in cognitive control networks and low metastability in sensory processing areas. Although metastability between resting state networks increased during task performance, cognitive ability was more closely linked to spontaneous activity. High metastability in the intrinsic connectivity of cognitive control networks was linked to novel problem solving or fluid intelligence, but was less important in tasks relying on previous experience or crystallised intelligence. Crucially, subjects with resting architectures similar or 'pre-configured' to a task-general arrangement demonstrated superior cognitive performance. Taken together, our findings support a key linkage between the spontaneous metastability of large-scale networks in the cerebral cortex and cognition.},

Bilateral imaging of neuronal activity in the mouse hippocampus reveals that, from one day to the next, $\backslash${\~{}}40{\%} of neurons change their responsiveness to cues, but thereafter only 1{\%} of cells change per day. Despite these changes, neuronal responses are resilient to a lack of exposure to a previously completed task or to hippocampus lesions. Unlike individual neurons, the responses of which change after a few days, groups of neurons with inter- and intrahemispheric synchronous activity show stable responses for several weeks. The likelihood that a neuron maintains its responsiveness across days is proportional to the number of neurons with which its activity is synchronous. Information stored in individual neurons is relatively labile, but it can be reliably stored in networks of synchronously active neurons.

abstract = {Spatio-temporally organized low-frequency fluctuations ({\textless}0.1 Hz), observed in {\{}BOLD{\}} {\{}fMRI{\}} signal during rest, suggest the existence of underlying network dynamics that emerge spontaneously from intrinsic brain processes. Furthermore, significant correlations between distinct anatomical regions-or functional connectivity ({\{}FC{\}})-have led to the identification of several widely distributed resting-state networks ({\{}RSNs{\}}). This slow dynamics seems to be highly structured by anatomical connectivity but the mechanism behind it and its relationship with neural activity, particularly in the gamma frequency range, remains largely unknown. Indeed, direct measurements of neuronal activity have revealed similar large-scale correlations, particularly in slow power fluctuations of local field potential gamma frequency range oscillations. To address these questions, we investigated neural dynamics in a large-scale model of the human brain's neural activity. A key ingredient of the model was a structural brain network defined by empirically derived long-range brain connectivity together with the corresponding conduction delays. A neural population, assumed to spontaneously oscillate in the gamma frequency range, was placed at each network node. When these oscillatory units are integrated in the network, they behave as weakly coupled oscillators. The time-delayed interaction between nodes is described by the Kuramoto model of phase oscillators, a biologically-based model of coupled oscillatory systems. For a realistic setting of axonal conduction speed, we show that time-delayed network interaction leads to the emergence of slow neural activity fluctuations, whose patterns correlate significantly with the empirically measured {\{}FC{\}}. The best agreement of the simulated {\{}FC{\}} with the empirically measured {\{}FC{\}} is found for a set of parameters where subsets of nodes tend to synchronize although the network is not globally synchronized. Inside such clusters, the simulated {\{}BOLD{\}} signal between nodes is found to be correlated, instantiating the empirically observed {\{}RSNs{\}}. Between clusters, patterns of positive and negative correlations are observed, as described in experimental studies. These results are found to be robust with respect to a biologically plausible range of model parameters. In conclusion, our model suggests how resting-state neural activity can originate from the interplay between the local neural dynamics and the large-scale structure of the brain.

abstract = {Patterns of resting state connectivity change dynamically and may represent modes of cognitive information processing. The diversity of connectivity patterns (global brain states) reflects the information capacity of the brain and determines the state of consciousness. In this work, computer simulation was used to explore the repertoire of global brain states as a function of cortical activation level. We implemented a modified spin glass model to describe UP/DOWN state transitions of neuronal populations at a mesoscopic scale based on resting state BOLD fMRI data. Resting state fMRI was recorded in 20 participants and mapped to 10,000 cortical regions (sites) defined on a group-aligned cortical surface map. Each site represented the population activity of a {\~{}}20 mm2 area of the cortex. Cross-correlation matrices of the mapped BOLD time courses of the set of sites were calculated and averaged across subjects. In the model, each cortical site was allowed to interact with the 16 other sites that had the highest pair-wise correlation values. All sites stochastically transitioned between UP and DOWN states under the net influence of their 16 pairs. The probability of local state transitions was controlled by a single parameter T corresponding to the level of global cortical activation. To estimate the number of distinct global states, first we ran 10,000 simulations at T = 0. Simulations were started from random configurations that converged to one of several distinct patterns. Using hierarchical clustering, at 99{\%} similarity, close to 300 distinct states were found. At intermediate T, metastable state configurations were formed suggesting critical behavior with a sharp increase in the number of metastable states at an optimal T. Both reduced activation (anesthesia, sleep) and increased activation (hyper-activation) moved the system away from equilibrium, presumably incompatible with conscious mentation. During equilibrium, the diversity of large-scale brain states was maximum, compatible with maximum information capacity—a presumed condition of consciousness.},

Here, we propose methods to suppress the anomalous synchronization and also to diminish the nonstationary behavior occurring in weakly coupled neural network under small-world topology. We consider a network of 2000 thermally sensitive identical neurons, based on the model of Hodgkin–Huxley in a small-world topology, with the probability of adding non local connection equal to p=0.001. Based on experimental protocols to suppress anomalous synchronization, as well as nonstationary behavior of the neural network dynamics, we make use of (i) external stimulus (pulsed current); (ii) biologic parameters changing (neuron membrane conductance changes); and (iii) body temperature changes. Quantification analysis to evaluate phase synchronization makes use of the Kuramoto's order parameter, while recurrence quantification analysis, particularly the determinism, computed over the easily accessible mean field of network, the local field potential (LFP), is used to evaluate nonstationary states. We show that the methods proposed can control the anomalous synchronization and nonstationarity occurring for weak coupling parameter without any effect on the individual neuron dynamics, neither in the expected asymptotic synchronized states occurring for large values of the coupling parameter.},

Our reasoning starts with the analysis of retinal ganglion cell data using maximum entropy models, showing that the population is robustly in a frustrated, marginally sub-critical, or glassy, state. This leads to an argument that neural populations in many other brain areas might share this structure. Next, we use latent variable models to show that this glassy state possesses well-defined clusters of neural activity. Clusters have three appealing properties: (i) clusters exhibit error correction, i.e., they are reproducibly elicited by the same stimulus despite variability at the level of constituent neurons; (ii) clusters encode qualitatively different visual features than their constituent neurons; and (iii) clusters can be learned by downstream neural circuits in an unsupervised fashion. We hypothesize that these properties give rise to a “learnable” neural code which the cortical hierarchy uses to extract increasingly complex features without supervision or reinforcement.},

Those hubs are, on their hand, connected together in a strong fashion ("rich-club" network). We have built a clustered scale-free network inspired in the cat cortex structure so as to study their dynamical properties. In this article, we focus on the synchronization of bursting activity of the cortical areas and how it can be suppressed by means of neuron deactivation through suitably applied light pulses. We show that it is possible to effectively suppress bursting synchronization by acting on a single, yet suitably chosen neuron, as long as it is highly connected, thanks to the "rich-club" structure of the network.},

It has been suggested that this so-called "binding problem" may be solved in the temporal domain. The hypothesis is that synchronization of neuronal discharges can serve for the integration of distributed neurons into cell assemblies and that this process may underlie the selection of perceptually and behaviorally relevant information. As we intend to show here, this temporal binding hypothesis has implications for the search of the neural correlate of consciousness. We review experimental results, mainly obtained in the visual system, which support the notion of temporal binding. In particular, we discuss recent experiments on the neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry which suggest that appropriate synchronization among cortical neurons may be one of the necessary conditions for the buildup of perceptual states and awareness of sensory stimuli.

In such a state, the oscillators form quantized clusters, where neither their phases nor their instantaneous frequencies are locked. The oscillators' instantaneous speeds are different within the clusters, but they form a characteristic cusped pattern and, more importantly, they behave periodically in time so that their average values are the same. Given its intrinsic specular nature with respect to the recently introduced Chimera states, the phase is termed the Bellerophon state. We provide an analytical and numerical description of Bellerophon states, and furnish practical hints on how to seek them in a variety of experimental and natural systems.},

abstract = {Since the first measurements of neuronal avalanches, the critical brain hypothesis has gained traction. However, if the brain is critical, what is the phase transition? For several decades, it has been known that the cerebral cortex operates in a diversity of regimes, ranging from highly synchronous states (with higher spiking variability) to desynchronized states (with lower spiking variability). Here, using both new and publicly available data, we test independent signatures of criticality and show that a phase transition occurs in an intermediate value of spiking variability, in both anesthetized and freely moving animals. The critical exponents point to a universality class different from mean-field directed percolation. Importantly, as the cortex hovers around this critical point, the avalanche exponents follow a linear relation that encompasses previous experimental results from different setups and is reproduced by a model.},

abstract = {We study the dynamical proprieties of phase synchronization and intermittent behavior of neural systems using a network of networks structure based on an experimentally obtained human connectome for healthy and Alzheimer-affected brains. We consider a network composed of 78 neural subareas (subnetworks) coupled with a mean-field potential scheme. Each subnetwork is characterized by a small-world topology, composed of 250 bursting neurons simulated through a Rulkov model. Using the Kuramoto order parameter we demonstrate that healthy and Alzheimer-affected brains display distinct phase synchronization and intermittence properties as a function of internal and external coupling strengths. In general, for the healthy case, each subnetwork develops a substantial level of internal synchronization before a global stable phase-synchronization state has been established. For the unhealthy case, despite the similar internal subnetwork synchronization levels, we identify higher levels of global phase synchronization occurring even for relatively small internal and external coupling. Using recurrence quantification analysis, namely the determinism of the mean-field potential, we identify regions where the healthy and unhealthy networks depict nonstationary behavior, but the results denounce the presence of a larger region or intermittent dynamics for the case of Alzheimer-affected networks. A possible theoretical explanation based on two locally stable but globally unstable states is discussed.},

We use the theory of bifurcation analysis to seek the control parameters domains in which neuronal activity is set up. The statistical synchronization factor is recorded in order to evaluate the network synchronicity degree. The firing activity is found to be favorable when the values of control parameters, namely the magnetic coupling strength and the external electromagnetic induction, are between low-threshold and upper-threshold and unfavorable elsewhere. Additionally, the increase of electrical coupling strength drastically reduces the domain of control parameters where neuronal synchronization is expected. Our findings suggest that a rich neuronal activity including quiescent state, spiking/bursting regimes, amplitude death phenomenon and global synchronization may be efficiently regulated by electromagnetic induction of intra-and extracellular media of thalamic neurons.},

abstract = {Timing and dynamics of information in the brain is a hot field in modern neuroscience. The analysis of the temporal evolution of brain information is crucially important for the understanding of higher cognitive mechanisms in normal and pathological states. From the perspective of information dynamics, in this review we discuss working memory capacity, language dynamics, goal-dependent behavior programming and other functions of brain activity. In contrast with the classical description of information theory, which is mostly algebraic, brain flow information dynamics deals with problems such as the stability/instability of information flows, their quality, the timing of sequential processing, the top-down cognitive control of perceptual information, and information creation. In this framework, different types of information flow instabilities correspond to different cognitive disorders. On the other hand, the robustness of cognitive activity is related to the control of the information flow stability. We discuss these problems using both experimental and theoretical approaches, and we argue that brain activity is better understood considering information flows in the phase space of the corresponding dynamical model. In particular, we show how theory helps to understand intriguing experimental results in this matter, and how recent knowledge inspires new theoretical formalisms that can be tested with modern experimental techniques.

With steady current or conductance stimulation, regular-spiking ({\{}RS{\}}) pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking ({\{}FS{\}}) inhibitory interneurons in layer 2/3 of somatosensory cortex exhibit type 1 and type 2 threshold behaviors, respectively. We compared the postsynaptic firing variability of type 1 {\{}RS{\}} and type 2 {\{}FS{\}} cells, during naturalistic, fluctuating conductance input. In {\{}RS{\}} neurons, increasing the level of independently random, shunting inhibition caused a monotonic increase in spike reliability, whereas in {\{}FS{\}} interneurons, there was an optimum level of shunting inhibition for achieving the most reliable spike generation and the most precise spike-time encoding. This was observed over a range of different degrees of synchrony, or correlation, in the input. {\{}RS{\}} cells displayed a progressive rise in spike jitter during natural-like transient burst inputs, whereas for {\{}FS{\}} cells, jitter was mostly kept low. Furthermore, {\{}RS{\}} cells showed encoding of the input level in the spike shape, whereas {\{}FS{\}} cells did not. These differences between the two cell types are consistent with a role of {\{}RS{\}} neurons as rate-coding integrators, and a role of {\{}FS{\}} neurons as resonators controlling the coherence of synchronous firing.},

abstract = {A widely discussed hypothesis in neuroscience is that transiently active ensembles of neurons, known as "cell assemblies," underlie numerous operations of the brain, from encoding memories to reasoning. However, the mechanisms responsible for the formation and disbanding of cell assemblies and temporal evolution of cell assembly sequences are not well understood. I introduce and review three interconnected topics, which could facilitate progress in defining cell assemblies, identifying their neuronal organization, and revealing causal relationships between assembly organization and behavior. First, I hypothesize that cell assemblies are best understood in light of their output product, as detected by "reader-actuator" mechanisms. Second, I suggest that the hierarchical organization of cell assemblies may be regarded as a neural syntax. Third, constituents of the neural syntax are linked together by dynamically changing constellations of synaptic weights ("synapsembles" ). The existing support for this tripartite framework is reviewed and strategies for experimental testing of its predictions are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Now it is time to understand how the many active neuronal groups interact with each other and how their communication is flexibly modulated to bring about our cognitive dynamics. I hypothesize that neuronal communication is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively, because their communication windows for input and for output are open at the same times. Thus, a flexible pattern of coherence defines a flexible communication structure, which subserves our cognitive flexibility.},

Each cortical area has a subnetwork with small-world properties. We verify that both networks exhibit rich-club organisation and phase synchronisation. Due to the fact that neuronal synchronisation can be related to brain diseases, we consider the delayed feedback control as a method to suppress synchronous behaviours. In this work, it is presented that depending on the feedback parameters, intensity and time delay, phase synchronisation in both networks can be suppressed. Therefore, one of our main results is to show that delayed feedback control can be used to suppress undesired synchronous behaviours not only in the healthy brain, but also in the brain marked by neurodegenerative processes.},

We analyze the functional connectivity of the network by calculating the mutual information between neuronal spike trains, allowing us to characterize the structures of synchronization in the network.

abstract = {We considered a clustered network of bursting neurons described by the Huber-Braun model. In the upper level of the network we used the connectivity matrix of the cat cerebral cortex network, and in the lower level each cortex area (or cluster) is modelled as a small-world network. There are two different coupling strengths related to inter- and intracluster dynamics. Each bursting cycle is composed of a quiescent period followed by a rapid chaotic sequence of spikes, and we defined a geometric phase which enables us to investigate the onset of synchronized bursting, as the state in which the neuron start bursting at the same time, whereas their spikes may remain uncorrelated. The bursting synchronization of a clustered network has been investigated using an order parameter and the average field of the network in order to identify regimes in which each cluster may display synchronized behavior, whereas the overall network does not. We introduce quantifiers to evaluate the relative contribution of each cluster in the partial synchronized behavior of the whole network. Our main finding is that we typically observe in the clustered network not a complete phase synchronized regime but instead a complex pattern of partial phase synchronization in which different cortical areas may be internally synchronized at distinct phase values, hence they are not externally synchronized, unless the coupling strengths are too large.},

abstract = {The motor signs of Parkinson's disease are thought to result in large part from a reduction of the level of dopamine in the basal ganglia. Over the last few years, many of the functional and anatomical consequences of dopamine loss in these structures have been identified, both in the basal ganglia and in related areas in thalamus and cortex. This knowledge has contributed significantly to our understanding of the link between the degeneration of dopamine neurons in the midbrain and the development of parkinsonism. This review discusses the evidence that implicates electrophysiologic changes (including altered discharge rates, increased incidence of burst firing, interneuronal synchrony, oscillatory activity, and altered sensorimotor processing) in basal ganglia, thalamus, and cortex, in parkinsonism. From these studies, parkinsonism emerges as a complex network disorder, in which abnormal activity in groups of neurons in the basal ganglia strongly affects the excitability, oscillatory activity, synchrony and sensory responses of areas of the cerebral cortex that are involved in the planning and execution of movement, as well as in executive, limbic or sensory functions. Detailed knowledge of these changes will help us to develop more effective and specific symptomatic treatments for patients with Parkinson's disease.},

Within today's dominant computational paradigm, these operations, involving synapses, membrane ionic channels and changes in membrane potential, are thought of as steps in an algorithm or as computations. The role of neurons in these computations has evolved conceptually from that of a simple integrator of synaptic inputs until a threshold is reached and an output pulse is initiated, to a much more sophisticated processor with mixed analog-digital logic and highly adaptive synaptic elements.},

abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex invariably involves the activation of millions of neurons that are widely distributed over its various areas. These distributed activity patterns need to be integrated into coherent representational states. A candidate mechanism for the integration and coordination of neuronal activity between different brain regions is synchronization on a fine temporal scale. In the visual cortex, synchronization occurs selectively between the responses of neurons that represent related features and that need to be integrated for the generation of coherent percepts; neurons in other areas of the cerebral cortex also synchronize their discharges. However, little is known about the patterns and the behavioural correlates of synchrony among widely separated cortical regions. Here we report that synchronization occurs between areas of the visual and parietal cortex, and between areas of the parietal and motor cortex, in the awake cat. When cats responded to a sudden change of a visual pattern, neuronal activity in cortical areas exhibited synchrony without time lags; this synchrony was particularly strong between areas subserving related functions. During reward and inter-trial episodes, zero-time-lag synchrony was lost and replaced by interactions exhibiting large and unsystematic time lags.},

In this Perspective we use the term "chronnectome" to describe metrics that allow a dynamic view of coupling. In the chronnectome, coupling refers to possibly time-varying levels of correlated or mutually informed activity between brain regions whose spatial properties may also be temporally evolving. We primarily focus on multivariate approaches developed in our group and review a number of approaches with an emphasis on matrix decompositions such as principle component analysis and independent component analysis. We also discuss the potential these approaches offer to improve characterization and understanding of brain function. There are a number of methodological directions that need to be developed further, but chronnectome approaches already show great promise for the study of both the healthy and the diseased brain.},

These networks have also been applied to the gross neural connectivity between primate cortical areas and the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we extend this work to a specific neural circuit of the vertebrate brain--the medial reticular formation ({\{}RF{\}}) of the brainstem--and, in doing so, we have made three key contributions. First, this work constitutes the first model (and quantitative review) of this important brain structure for over three decades. Second, we have developed the first graph-theoretic analysis of vertebrate brain connectivity at the neural network level. Third, we propose simple metrics to quantitatively assess the extent to which the networks studied are small-world or scale-free. We conclude that the medial {\{}RF{\}} is configured to create small-world (implying coherent rapid-processing capabilities), but not scale-free, type networks under assumptions which are amenable to quantitative measurement.},

abstract = {Brain imaging data are generally used to determine which brain regions are most active in an experimental paradigm or in a group of subjects. Theoretical considerations suggest that it would also be of interest to know which set of brain regions are most interactive in a given task or group of subjects. A subset of regions that are much more strongly interactive among themselves than with the rest of the brain is called here a functional cluster. Functional clustering can be assessed by calculating for each subset of brain regions a measure, the cluster index, obtained by dividing the statistical dependence within the subset by that between the subset and rest of the brain. A cluster index value near 1 indicates a homogeneous system, while a high cluster index indicates that a subset of brain regions forms a distinct functional cluster. Within a functional cluster, individual brain regions are ranked at the center or at the periphery according to their statistical dependence with the rest of that cluster. The applicability of this approach has been tested on {\{}PET{\}} data obtained from normal and schizophrenic subjects performing a set of cognitive tasks. Analysis of the data reveals evidence of functional clustering. A comparative evaluation of which regions are more peripheral or more central suggests distinct differences between the two groups of subjects. We consider the applicability of this analysis to data obtained with imaging modalities offering higher temporal resolution than {\{}PET{\}}.},

abstract = {A network of oscillatory bursting neurons with excitatory coupling is hypothesized to define the primary kernel for respiratory rhythm generation in the pre-B{\"{o}}tzinger complex (pre-B{\"{o}}{\{}tC{\}}) in mammals. Two minimal models of these neurons are proposed. In model 1, bursting arises via fast activation and slow inactivation of a persistent Na+ current {\{}INaP{\}}-h. In model 2, bursting arises via a fast-activating persistent Na+ current {\{}INaP{\}} and slow activation of a K+ current {\{}IKS{\}}. In both models, action potentials are generated via fast Na+ and K+ currents. The two models have few differences in parameters to facilitate a rigorous comparison of the two different burst-generating mechanisms. Both models are consistent with many of the dynamic features of electrophysiological recordings from pre-B{\"{o}}{\{}tC{\}} oscillatory bursting neurons in vitro, including voltage-dependent activity modes (silence, bursting, and beating), a voltage-dependent burst frequency that can vary from 0.05 to {\textgreater}1 Hz, and a decaying spike frequency during bursting. These results are robust and persist across a wide range of parameter values for both models. However, the dynamics of model 1 are more consistent with experimental data in that the burst duration decreases as the baseline membrane potential is depolarized and the model has a relatively flat membrane potential trajectory during the interburst interval. We propose several experimental tests to demonstrate the validity of either model and to differentiate between the two mechanisms.},

abstract = {It is not clear how, after a large perturbation, the brain explores the vast space of potential neuronal activity states to recover those compatible with consciousness. Here, we analyze recovery from pharmacologically induced coma to show that neuronal activity en route to consciousness is confined to a low-dimensional subspace. In this subspace, neuronal activity forms discrete metastable states persistent on the scale of minutes. The network of transitions that links these metastable states is structured such that some states form hubs that connect groups of otherwise disconnected states. Although many paths through the network are possible, to ultimately enter the activity state compatible with consciousness, the brain must first pass through these hubs in an orderly fashion. This organization of metastable states, along with dramatic dimensionality reduction, significantly simplifies the task of sampling the parameter space to recover the state consistent with wakefulness on a physiologically relevant timescale.},

abstract = {This paper considers state-dependent dynamics that mediate perception in the brain. In particular, it considers the formal basis of self-organized instabilities that enable perceptual transitions during Bayes-optimal perception. The basic phenomena we consider are perceptual transitions that lead to conscious ignition (Dehaene and Changeux, 2011) and how they depend on dynamical instabilities that underlie chaotic itinerancy (Breakspear, 2001; Tsuda, 2001) and self-organized criticality (Beggs and Plenz, 2003; Plenz and Thiagarajan, 2007; Shew et al., 2011). Our approach is based on a dynamical formulation of perception as approximate Bayesian inference, in terms of variational free energy minimization. This formulation suggests that perception has an inherent tendency to induce dynamical instabilities (critical slowing) that enable the brain to respond sensitively to sensory perturbations. We briefly review the dynamics of perception, in terms of generalized Bayesian filtering and free energy minimization, present a formal conjecture about self-organized instability and then test this conjecture, using neuronal (numerical) simulations of perceptual categorization.},

abstract = {Increasing interest in the study of coordinated activity of brain cell ensembles reflects the current conceptualization of brain information processing and cognition. It is thought that cognitive processes involve not only serial stages of sensory signal processing, but also massive parallel information processing circuitries, and therefore it is the coordinated activity of neuronal networks of brains that give rise to cognition and consciousness in general. While the concepts and techniques to measure synchronization are relatively well characterized and developed in the mathematics and physics community, the measurement of coordinated activity derived from brain signals is not a trivial task, and is currently a subject of debate. Coordinated Activity in the Brain: Measurements and Relevance to Brain Function and Behavior addresses conceptual and methodological limitations, as well as advantages, in the assessment of cellular coordinated activity from neurophysiological recordings. The book offers a broad overview of the field for investigators working in a variety of disciplines (neuroscience, biophysics, mathematics, physics, neurology, neurosurgery, psychology, biomedical engineering, computer science/computational biology), and introduces future trends for understanding brain activity and its relation to cognition and pathologies. This work will be valuable to professional investigators and clinicians, graduate and post-graduate students in related fields of neuroscience and biophysics, and to anyone interested in signal analysis techniques for studying brain function},

abstract = {One of the most intriguing features of the brain is its ability to be malleable, allowing it to adapt continually to changes in the environment. Specific neuronal activity patterns drive long-lasting increases or decreases in the strength of synaptic connections, referred to as long-term potentiation and long-term depression, respectively. Such phenomena have been described in a variety of model organisms, which are used to study molecular, structural, and functional aspects of synaptic plasticity. This review originated from the first International Society for Neurochemistry (ISN) and Journal of Neurochemistry (JNC) Flagship School held in Alpbach, Austria (Sep 2016), and will use its curriculum and discussions as a framework to review some of the current knowledge in the field of synaptic plasticity. First, we describe the role of plasticity during development and the persistent changes of neural circuitry occurring when sensory input is altered during critical developmental stages. We then outline the signaling cascades resulting in the synthesis of new plasticity-related proteins, which ultimately enable sustained changes in synaptic strength. Going beyond the traditional understanding of synaptic plasticity conceptualized by long-term potentiation and long-term depression, we discuss system-wide modifications and recently unveiled homeostatic mechanisms, such as synaptic scaling. Finally, we describe the neural circuits and synaptic plasticity mechanisms driving associative memory and motor learning. Evidence summarized in this review provides a current view of synaptic plasticity in its various forms, offers new insights into the underlying mechanisms and behavioral relevance, and provides directions for future research in the field of synaptic plasticity.

abstract = {Neuronal circuitry is often considered a clean slate that can be dynamically and arbitrarily molded by experience. However, when we investigated synaptic connectivity in groups of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex, we found that both connectivity and synaptic weights were surprisingly predictable. Synaptic weights followvery closely the number of connections in a group of neurons, saturating after only 20{\%} of possible connections are formed between neurons in a group. When we examined the network topology of connectivity between neurons, we found that the neurons cluster into small world networks that are not scale-free, with less than 2 degrees of separation.We found a simple clustering rule where connectivity is directly proportional to the number of common neighbors, which accounts for these small world networks and accurately predicts the connection probability between any two neurons. This pyramidal neuron network clusters into multiple groups of a few dozen neurons each. The neurons composing each group are surprisingly distributed, typically more than 100 $\mu$mapart, allowing for multiple groups to be interlaced in the same space. In summary, we discovered a synaptic organizing principle that groups neurons in a manner that is common across animals and hence, independent of individual experiences. We speculate that these elementary neuronal groups are prescribed Lego-like building blocks of perception and that acquired memory relies more on combining these elementary assemblies into higher-order constructs.},

abstract = {We report on self-induced switchings between multiple distinct space-time patterns in the dynamics of a spatially extended excitable system. These switchings between low-amplitude oscillations, nonlinear waves, and extreme events strongly resemble a random process, although the system is deterministic. We show that a chaotic saddle-which contains all the patterns as well as channel-like structures that mediate the transitions between them-is the backbone of such a pattern-switching dynamics. Our analyses indicate that essential ingredients for the observed phenomena are that the system behaves like an inhomogeneous oscillatory medium that is capable of self-generating spatially localized excitations and that is dominated by short-range connections but also features long-range connections. With our findings, we present an alternative to the well-known ways to obtain self-induced pattern switching, namely, noise-induced attractor hopping, heteroclinic orbits, and adaptation to an external signal. This alternative way can be expected to improve our understanding of pattern switchings in spatially extended natural dynamical systems like the brain and the heart.},

abstract = {The study of spontaneous fluctuations of brain activity, often referred as brain noise, is getting increasing attention in functional magnetic resonance imaging ({\{}fMRI{\}}) studies. Despite important efforts, much of the statistical properties of such fluctuations remain largely unknown. This work scrutinizes these fluctuations looking at specific statistical properties which are relevant to clarify its dynamical origins. Here, three statistical features which clearly differentiate brain data from naive expectations for random processes are uncovered: First, the variance of the {\{}fMRI{\}} mean signal as a function of the number of averaged voxels remains constant across a wide range of observed clusters sizes. Second, the anomalous behavior of the variance is originated by bursts of synchronized activity across regions, regardless of their widely different sizes. Finally, the correlation length (i.e., the length at which the correlation strength between two regions vanishes) as well as mutual information diverges with the cluster's size considered, such that arbitrarily large clusters exhibit the same collective dynamics than smaller ones. These three properties are known to be exclusive of complex systems exhibiting critical dynamics, where the spatio-temporal dynamics show these peculiar type of fluctuations. Thus, these findings are fully consistent with previous reports of brain critical dynamics, and are relevant for the interpretation of the role of fluctuations and variability in brain function in health and disease.},

abstract = {What is the relationship between brain and behavior? The answer to this question necessitates characterizing the mapping between structure and function. The aim of this paper is to discuss broad issues surrounding the link between structure and function in the brain that will motivate a network perspective to understanding this question. However, as others in the past, I argue that a network perspective should supplant the common strategy of understanding the brain in terms of individual regions. Whereas this perspective is needed for a fuller characterization of the mind-brain, it should not be viewed as panacea. For one, the challenges posed by the many-to-many mapping between regions and functions is not dissolved by the network perspective. Although the problem is ameliorated, one should not anticipate a one-to. one mapping when the network approach is adopted. Furthermore, decomposition of the brain network in terms of meaningful clusters of regions, such as the ones generated by community-finding algorithms, does not by itself reveal "true" subnetworks. Given the hierarchical and multi-relational relationship between regions, multiple decompositions will offer different "slices" of a broader landscape of networks within the brain. Finally, I described how the function of brain regions can be characterized in a multidimensional manner via the idea of diversity profiles. The concept can also be used to describe the way different brain regions participate in networks. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The network architecture of the human brain has become a feature of increasing interest to the neuroscientific community, largely because of its potential to illuminate human cognition, its variation over development and aging, and its alteration in disease or injury. Traditional tools and approaches to study this architecture have largely focused on single scales—of topology, time, and space. Expanding beyond this narrow view, we focus this review on pertinent questions and novel methodological advances for the multi-scale brain. We separate our exposition into content related to multi-scale topological structure, multi-scale temporal structure, and multi-scale spatial structure. In each case, we recount empirical evidence for such structures, survey network-based methodological approaches to reveal these structures, and outline current frontiers and open questions. Although predominantly peppered with examples from human neuroimaging, we hope that this account will offer an accessible guide to any neuroscientist aiming to measure, characterize, and understand the full richness of the brain's multiscale network structure—irrespective of species, imaging modality, or spatial resolution.},

This is currently a major challenge for neuroscience. Most research, whether dealing with perception, action or learning, focuses on a few levels of organization, for instance the molecular level and brain imaging, and leaves other crucial areas practically untouched. To reach the level of understanding that we desire, a multi-level approach is required in which the different levels link into each other. It is possible to bridge across the different levels for one system, and this has been demonstrated, for example, in the lamprey in generation of goal-directed locomotion. It can be argued that an integrated analysis of any neural system cannot be performed without the aid of a close interaction between experiments and modelling. The dynamic processing within any neural system is such that an intuitive interpretation is rarely sufficient.},

One of the major challenges in neuroscience is to understand the basic physiological mechanisms underlying the complex spatiotemporal patterns of spiking activity observed during normal brain functioning, and to determine the origins of pathological dynamical states such as epileptic seizures and Parkinsonian tremors. A second major challenge is to understand how the patterns of spiking activity provide a substrate for the encoding and transmission of information, that is, how do neurons compute with spikes? It is likely that an important element of both the dynamical and computational properties of neurons is that they can exhibit bursting, which is a relatively slow rhythmic alternation between an active phase of rapid spiking and a quiescent phase without spiking. This book provides a detailed overview of the current state-of-the-art in the mathematical and computational modeling of bursting, with contributions from many of the leading researchers in the field.},

In the auditory cortex, however, response variability can be very low. We have used in vivo whole cell patch-clamp methods to study the trial-to-trial variability of the subthreshold fluctuations in membrane potential underlying tone-evoked responses in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats. Using methods adapted from classical quantal analysis, we partitioned this subthreshold variability into a private component (which includes synaptic, thermal, and other sources local to the recorded cell) and a shared component arising from network interactions. Here we report that this private component is remarkably small, usually about 1-3 {\{}mV{\}}, as quantified by the variance divided by the mean of the ensemble of tone-evoked response heights. The shared component can be much larger, and shows more heterogeneity across the population, ranging from about 0 to 10 {\{}mV{\}}. The remarkable fact that, at least 5 synapses from the auditory periphery, this variability remains so small raises the possibility that the intervening neural circuitry is organized so as to prevent private noise from accumulating as neural signals propagate to the cortex.},

We report a program of research that uses the theoretical concepts of coordination dynamics and quantitative measurements of simple, well-defined experimental model systems to explicitly relate neural and behavioral levels of description in human beings. Our approach is both top-down and bottom-up and aims at ending up in the same place: top-down to derive behavioral patterns from neural fields, and bottom-up to generate neural field patterns from bidirectional coupling between astrocytes and neurons. Much progress can be made by recognizing that the two approaches-reductionism and emergentism-are complementary.

It has become clear that simple activation studies are no longer sufficient. There is an urgent need to understand the brain as a complex structural and functional network. Interest in brain network studies has increased strongly with the advent of modern network theory and increasingly powerful investigative techniques such as "high-density {\{}EEG{\}}", {\{}MEG{\}}, functional and structural {\{}MRI{\}}. Modern network studies of the brain have demonstrated that healthy brains self-organize towards so-called "small-world networks" characterized by a combination of dense local connectivity and critical long-distance connections. In addition, normal brain networks display hierarchical modularity, and a connectivity backbone that consists of interconnected hub nodes. This complex architecture is believed to arise under genetic control and to underlie cognition and intelligence.

@article{hudson_2017,
abstract = {There is strong evidence that anesthetics have stereotypical effects on brain state, so that a given anesthetic appears to have a signature in the electroencephalogram (EEG), which may vary with dose. This can be usefully interpreted as the anesthetic determining an attractor in the phase space of the brain. How brain activity shifts between these attractors in time remains understudied, as most studies implicitly assume a one-to-one relationship between drug dose and attractor features by assuming stationarity over the analysis interval and analyzing data segments of several minutes in length. Yet data in rats anesthetized with isoflurane suggests that, at anesthetic levels consistent with surgical anesthesia, brain activity alternates between multiple attractors, often spending on the order of 10 min in one activity pattern before shifting to another. Moreover, the probability of these jumps between attractors changes with anesthetic concentration. This suggests the hypothesis that brain state is metastable during anesthesia: though it appears at equilibrium on short timescales (on the order of seconds to a few minutes), longer intervals show shifting behavior. Compelling evidence for metastability in rats anesthetized with isoflurane is reviewed, but so far only suggestive hints of metastability in brain states exist with other anesthetics or in other species. Explicit testing of metastability during anesthesia will require experiments with longer acquisition intervals and carefully designed analytic approaches; some of the implications of these constraints are reviewed for typical spectral analysis approaches. If metastability exists during anesthesia, it implies degeneracy in the relationship between brain state and effect site concentration, as there is not a one-to-one mapping between the two. This degeneracy could explain some of the reported difficulty in using brain activity monitors to titrate drug dose to prevent awareness during anesthesia and should force a rethinking of the notion of depth of anesthesia as a single dimension. Finally, explicit incorporation of knowledge of the dynamics of the brain during anesthesia could offer better depth of anesthesia monitoring.},

abstract = {We propose a method for the time-resolved joint analysis of two related aspects of single neuron variability, the spiking irregularity measured by the squared coefficient of variation ({\{}CV{\}}(2)) of the {\{}ISIs{\}} and the trial-by-trial variability of the spike count measured by the Fano factor ({\{}FF{\}}). We provide a calibration of both estimators using the theory of renewal processes, and verify it for spike trains recorded in vitro. Both estimators exhibit a considerable bias for short observations that count less than about 5-10 spikes on average. The practical difficulty of measuring the {\{}CV{\}}(2) in rate modulated data can be overcome by a simple procedure of spike train demodulation which was tested in numerical simulations and in real spike trains. We propose to test neuronal spike trains for deviations from the null-hypothesis {\{}FF{\}}={\{}CV{\}}(2). We show that cortical pyramidal neurons, recorded under controlled stationary input conditions in vitro, comply with this assumption. Performing a time-resolved joint analysis of {\{}CV{\}}(2) and {\{}FF{\}} of a single unit recording from the motor cortex of a behaving monkey we demonstrate how the dynamic change of their quantitative relation can be interpreted with respect to neuron intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence cortical variability in vivo. Finally, we discuss the effect of several additional factors such as serial interval correlation and refractory period on the empiric relation of {\{}FF{\}} and {\{}CV{\}}(2).},

abstract = {The neurons of cerebral cortex are largely autonomous and generate activity that is manifested in trains of microscopic axonal action potentials. The neurons interact by sparse but numerous synaptic connections to generate macroscopic dendritic activity patterns that are observed in electroencephalographic ({\{}EEG{\}}) waves. The macroscopic patterns are constructed by the populations and they shape the output of cortical neurons in parallel arrays. Sensory cortexes receive sensory information in the form of microscopic action potentials, which induce state transitions in population dynamics. Each state transition transforms sensory information to perceptual meaning. The {\{}EEG{\}} reflects both kinds of activity. The sensory input is accessed by time ensemble averaging, whereas the perceptual output is found by spatial ensemble averaging. Spatial phase gradients in the {\{}EEG{\}} are useful for identifying {\{}EEG{\}} segments in a sequence of state transitions in response to sensory input. The rapidity and flexibility with which they take place give strong reason to postulate that the mechanism for the construction of these sequences of patterns is a dynamical system operating in a chaotic domain.},

We use connectome based computational brain network modeling to reveal fundamental principles of how the human brain generates large-scale activity observable by noninvasive neuroimaging. We used structural and functional neuroimaging data to construct whole-brain models. With this novel approach, we reveal that the human brain during resting state operates at maximum metastability, i.e. in a state of maximum network switching. In addition, we investigate cortical heterogeneity across areas. Optimization of the spectral characteristics of each local brain region revealed the dynamical cortical core of the human brain, which is driving the activity of the rest of the whole brain. Brain network modelling goes beyond correlational neuroimaging analysis and reveals non-trivial network mechanisms underlying non-invasive observations. Our novel findings significantly pertain to the important role of computational connectomics in understanding principles of brain function.},

abstract = {Neural ensembles oscillate across a broad range of frequencies and are transiently coupled or "bound" together when people attend to a stimulus, perceive, think, and act. This is a dynamic, self-assembling process, with parts of the brain engaging and disengaging in time. But how is it done? The theory of Coordination Dynamics proposes a mechanism called metastability, a subtle blend of integration and segregation. Tendencies for brain regions to express their individual autonomy and specialized functions (segregation, modularity) coexist with tendencies to couple and coordinate globally for multiple functions (integration). Although metastability has garnered increasing attention, it has yet to be demonstrated and treated within a fully spatiotemporal perspective. Here, we illustrate metastability in continuous neural and behavioral recordings, and we discuss theory and experiments at multiple scales, suggesting that metastable dynamics underlie the real-time coordination necessary for the brain's dynamic cognitive, behavioral, and social functions. How does the transient coupling of neural ensembles that supports cognitive function occur? Tognoli and Kelso consider a mechanism known as metastability, discussing theory and data at multiple scales that suggest that metastable dynamics underlies the coordination necessary for the brain's dynamic functions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Both response modes efficiently relay information to the cortex in behaving animals, but have markedly different consequences for information processing. The lateral geniculate nucleus, which is the thalamic relay of retinal information to cortex, provides a reasonable model for all of thalamus. Compared with burst mode, geniculate relay cells that are firing in tonic mode exhibit better linear summation, but have poorer detectability for visual stimuli. The switch between the response modes can be controlled by nonretinal, modulatory afferents to these cells, such as the feedback pathway from cortex. This allows the thalamus to provide a dynamic relay that affects the nature and format of information that reaches the cortex.},

abstract = {Single-trial analyses of ensemble activity in alert animals demonstrate that cortical circuits dynamics evolve through temporal sequences of metastable states. Metastability has been studied for its potential role in sensory coding, memory, and decision-making. Yet, very little is known about the network mechanisms responsible for its genesis. It is often assumed that the onset of state sequences is triggered by an external stimulus. Here we show that state sequences can be observed also in the absence of overt sensory stimulation. Analysis of multielectrode recordings from the gustatory cortex of alert rats revealed ongoing sequences of states, where single neurons spontaneously attain several firing rates across different states. This single-neuron multistability represents a challenge to existing spiking network models, where typically each neuron is at most bistable. We present a recurrent spiking network model that accounts for both the spontaneous generation of state sequences and the multistability in single-neuron firing rates. Each state results from the activation of neural clusters with potentiated intracluster connections, with the firing rate in each cluster depending on the number of active clusters. Simulations show that the model's ensemble activity hops among the different states, reproducing the ongoing dynamics observed in the data. When probed with external stimuli, the model predicts the quenching of single-neuron multistability into bistability and the reduction of trial-by-trial variability. Both predictions were confirmed in the data. Together, these results provide a theoretical framework that captures both ongoing and evoked network dynamics in a single mechanistic model.},

More important, the {\{}AD{\}} patients exhibited increased shortest path length and decreased global efficiency in {\{}WM{\}} network compared with controls, implying abnormal topological organization.

Specifically, {\{}AD{\}} patients were found to have reduced nodal efficiency predominantly located in the frontal regions. Finally, we showed that the alterations of various network properties were significantly correlated with the behavior performances.

By studying networks of attractors in the system's phase space, it is shown how different perturbations may evoke specific switches between various patterns of behavior. This ensures that different odors, even if present at extremely low concentrations, are able to evoke a specific spatio-temporal behavior in the olfactory bulb, permitting their unique perception. The model incorporates many of the processes proposed to mediate perception, such as the topographic organisation of sensory systems, destabilization of cortex by sensory input and synchronisation between neurons. It is also consistent with the character of the olfactory electroencephalogram.},

However, a detailed experimental investigation of this interplay at both cellular and population scales in the living brain is limited by accessibility. Alternatively, to investigate the basic operational principles with morphological, electrophysiological and computational methods, the activity emerging from large in vitro networks of primary neurons organized with imposed topologies can be studied. Here, we validated the use of a new bio-printing approach, which effectively maintains the topology of hippocampal cultures in vitro and investigated, by patch-clamp and {\{}MEA{\}} electrophysiology, the emerging functional properties of these grid-confined networks. In spite of differences in the organization of physical connectivity, our bio-patterned grid networks retained the key properties of synaptic transmission, short-term plasticity and overall network activity with respect to random networks. Interestingly, the imposed grid topology resulted in a reinforcement of functional connections along orthogonal directions, shorter connectivity links and a greatly increased spiking probability in response to focal stimulation. These results clearly demonstrate that reliable functional studies can nowadays be performed on large neuronal networks in the presence of sustained changes in the physical network connectivity.},

abstract = {At the macroscopic scale, the human brain can be described as a complex network of white matter tracts integrating grey matter assemblies - the human connectome. The structure of the connectome, which is often described using graph theoretic approaches, can be used to model macroscopic brain function at low computational cost. Here, we use the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators with time-delays, calibrated with respect to empirical functional MRI data, to study the relation between the structure of the connectome and two aspects of functional brain dynamics - synchrony, a measure of general coherence, and metastability, a measure of dynamical flexibility. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the local structure of the connectome, quantified using graph theory, and the synchrony and metastability of the model's dynamics. By removing individual nodes and all of their connections from the model, we study the effect of lesions on both global and local dynamics. Of the nine nodal graph-theoretical properties tested, two were able to predict effects of node lesion on the global dynamics. The removal of nodes with high eigenvector centrality leads to decreases in global synchrony and increases in global metastability, as does the removal of hub nodes joining topologically segregated network modules. At the level of local dynamics in the neighbourhood of the lesioned node, structural properties of the lesioned nodes hold more predictive power, as five nodal graph theoretical measures are related to changes in local dynamics following node lesions. We discuss these results in the context of empirical studies of stroke and functional brain dynamics.},

abstract = {Anomalous phase synchronization describes a synchronization phenomenon occurring even for the weakly coupled network and characterized by a non-monotonous dependence of the synchronization strength on the coupling strength. Its existence may support a theoretical framework to some neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's and some episodes of seizure behavior generated by epilepsy. Despite the success of controlling or suppressing the anomalous phase synchronization in neural networks applying external perturbations or inducing ambient changes, the origin of the anomalous phase synchronization as well as the mechanisms behind the suppression is not completely known. Here, we consider networks composed of N=2000 coupled neurons in a small-world topology for two well known neuron models, namely, the Hodgkin-Huxley-like and the Hindmarsh-Rose models, both displaying the anomalous phase synchronization regime. We show that the anomalous phase synchronization may be related to the individual behavior of the coupled neurons; particularly, we identify a strong correlation between the behavior of the inter-bursting-intervals of the neurons, what we call neuron variability, to the ability of the network to depict anomalous phase synchronization. We corroborate the ideas showing that external perturbations or ambient parameter changes that eliminate anomalous phase synchronization and at the same time promote small changes in the individual dynamics of the neurons, such that an increasing individual variability of neurons implies a decrease of anomalous phase synchronization. Finally, we demonstrate that this effect can be quantified using a well known recurrence quantifier, the "determinism." Moreover, the results obtained by the determinism are based on only the mean field potential of the network, turning these measures more suitable to be used in experimental situations.},

abstract = {Predicting the evolution of multispecies ecological systems is an intriguing problem. A sufficiently complex model with the necessary predicting power requires solutions that are structurally stable. Small variations of the system parameters should not qualitatively perturb its solutions. When one is interested in just asymptotic results of evolution (as time goes to infinity), then the problem has a straightforward mathematical image involving simple attractors (fixed points or limit cycles) of a dynamical system. However, for an accurate prediction of evolution, the analysis of transient solutions is critical. In this paper, in the framework of the traditional Lotka-Volterra model (generalized in some sense), we show that the transient solution representing multispecies sequential competition can be reproducible and predictable with high probability. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Detailed anatomical understanding of the human brain is essential for unraveling its functional architecture, yet current reference atlases have major limitations such as lack of whole-brain coverage, relatively low image resolution, and sparse structural annotation. We present the first digital human brain atlas to incorporate neuroimaging, high-resolution histology, and chemoarchitecture across a complete adult female brain, consisting of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and 1,356 large-format cellular resolution (1 µm/pixel) Nissl and immunohistochemistry anatomical plates. The atlas is comprehensively annotated for 862 structures, including 117 white matter tracts and several novel cyto- and chemoarchitecturally defined structures, and these annotations were transferred onto the matching MRI dataset. Neocortical delineations were done for sulci, gyri, and modified Brodmann areas to link macroscopic anatomical and microscopic cytoarchitectural parcellations. Correlated neuroimaging and histological structural delineation allowed fine feature identification in MRI data and subsequent structural identification in MRI data from other brains. This interactive online digital atlas is integrated with existing Allen Institute for Brain Science gene expression atlases and is publicly accessible as a resource for the neuroscience community. J.

abstract = {The scientific study of human consciousness has greatly benefited from the development of non-invasive brain imaging methods. The quest to identify the neural correlates of consciousness combined psychophysical experimentation with neuroimaging tools such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the changes in neural activity associated with conscious vs. unconscious percepts. Different neuroimaging methods have also been applied to characterize spontaneous brain activity fluctuations during altered states of consciousness, and to develop quantitative metrics for the level of consciousness. Most of these studies, however, have not explored the dynamic nature of the whole-brain imaging data provided by fMRI. A series of empirical and computational studies strongly suggests that the temporal fluctuations observed in this data present a non-trivial structure, and that this structure is compatible with the exploration of a discrete repertoire of states. In this review we focus on how dynamic neuroimaging can be used to address theoretical accounts of consciousness based on the hypothesis of a dynamic core, i.e. a constantly evolving and transiently stable set of coordinated neurons that constitute an integrated and differentiated physical substrate for each conscious experience. We review work exploring the possibility that metastability in brain dynamics leads to a repertoire of dynamic core states, and discuss how it might be modified during altered states of consciousness. This discussion prompts us to review neuroimaging studies aimed to map the dynamic exploration of the repertoire of states as a function of consciousness. Complementary studies of the dynamic core hypothesis using perturbative methods are also discussed. Finally, we propose that a link between metastability in brain dynamics and the level of consciousness could pave the way towards a mechanistic understanding of altered states of consciousness using tools from dynamical systems theory and statistical physics.},

Here, we analyze the paradigmatic network composed of neurons of Rulkov to investigate dynamic properties of the transitions to phase synchronization displayed by networks under two different topologies of the connection matrices, namely, small-world and random ones. Our analyses of both connection architectures reveal that neural networks under small-world topology display higher sensibility to initial conditions, and contrarily to the random connection case, depict a nonstationary transition to phase synchronization through the presence of a two-state on–off intermittency. The analyses are based on the recurrence quantifier determinism calculated by using only the local (mean) field potential ({\{}LFP{\}}) of the network, an experimentally easy accessible data. The use of {\{}LFP{\}} data offers advantages in the quantification of the nonstationary dynamics at the transition to phase synchronized states, since the more traditional Kuramoto order parameter must be computed over the individual signals of the neurons.},

abstract = {Transient oscillations in network activity upon sensory stimulation have been reported in different sensory areas of the brain. These evoked oscillations are the generic response of networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons ({\{}EI{\}}-networks) to a transient external input. Recently, it has been shown that this resonance property of {\{}EI{\}}-networks can be exploited for communication in modular neuronal networks by enabling the transmission of sequences of synchronous spike volleys ('pulse packets'), despite the sparse and weak connectivity between the modules. The condition for successful transmission is that the pulse packet ({\{}PP{\}}) intervals match the period of the modules' resonance frequency. Hence, the mechanism was termed communication through resonance ({\{}CTR{\}}). This mechanism has three severe constraints, though. First, it needs periodic trains of {\{}PPs{\}}, whereas single {\{}PPs{\}} fail to propagate. Second, the inter-{\{}PP{\}} interval needs to match the network resonance. Third, transmission is very slow, because in each module, the network resonance needs to build up over multiple oscillation cycles. Here, we show that, by adding appropriate feedback connections to the network, the {\{}CTR{\}} mechanism can be improved and the aforementioned constraints relaxed. Specifically, we show that adding feedback connections between two upstream modules, called the resonance pair, in an otherwise feedforward modular network can support successful propagation of a single {\{}PP{\}} throughout the entire network. The key condition for successful transmission is that the sum of the forward and backward delays in the resonance pair matches the resonance frequency of the network modules. The transmission is much faster, by more than a factor of two, than in the original {\{}CTR{\}} mechanism. Moreover, it distinctly lowers the threshold for successful communication by synchronous spiking in modular networks of weakly coupled networks. Thus, our results suggest a new functional role of bidirectional connectivity for the communication in cortical area networks.},

The analysis reveals a rich repertoire of states, including synchronous states in which neurons fire regularly; asynchronous states with stationary global activity and very irregular individual cell activity; and states in which the global activity oscillates but individual cells fire irregularly, typically at rates lower than the global oscillation frequency. The network can switch between these states, provided the external frequency, or the balance between excitation and inhibition, is varied. Two types of network oscillations are observed. In the fast oscillatory state, the network frequency is almost fully controlled by the synaptic time scale. In the slow oscillatory state, the network frequency depends mostly on the membrane time constant. Finite size effects in the asynchronous state are also discussed.},

abstract = {1. The physiological and functional features of time-dependent anomalous rectification activated by hyperpolarization and the current which underlies it, Ih, were examined in guinea-pig and cat thalamocortical relay neurones using in vitro intracellular recording techniques in thalamic slices. 2. Hyperpolarization of the membrane from rest with a constant-current pulse resulted in time-dependent rectification, expressed as a depolarizing sag of the membrane potential back towards rest. Under voltage clamp conditions, hyperpolarizing steps to membrane potentials negative to approximately -60 {\{}mV{\}} were associated with the activation of a slow inward current, Ih, which showed no inactivation with time. 3. The activation curve of the conductance underlying Ih was obtained through analysis of tail currents and ranged from -60 to -90 {\{}mV{\}}, with half-activation occurring at -75 {\{}mV{\}}. The time course of activation of Ih was well fitted by a single-exponential function and was strongly voltage dependent, with time constants ranging from greater than 1-2 s at threshold to an average of 229 ms at -95 {\{}mV{\}}. The time course of de-activation was also described by a single-exponential function, was voltage dependent, and the time constant ranged from an average of 1000 ms at -80 {\{}mV{\}} to 347 ms at -55 {\{}mV{\}}. 4. Raising [K+]o from 2.5 to 7.5 {\{}mM{\}} enhanced, while decreasing [Na+]o from 153 to 26 {\{}mM{\}} reduced, the amplitude of Ih. In addition, reduction of [Na+]o slowed the rate of Ih activation. These results indicate that Ih is carried by both Na+ and K+ ions, which is consistent with the extrapolated reversal potential of -43 {\{}mV{\}}. Replacement of Cl- in the bathing medium with isethionate shifted the chloride equilibrium potential positive by approximately 30-70 {\{}mV{\}}, evoked an inward shift of the holding current at -50 {\{}mV{\}}, and resulted in a marked reduction of instantaneous currents as well as Ih, suggesting a non-specific blocking action of impermeable anions. 5. Local (2-10 {\{}mM{\}} in micropipette) or bath (1-2 {\{}mM{\}}) applications of Cs+ abolished Ih over the whole voltage range tested (-60 to -110 {\{}mV{\}}), with no consistent effects on instantaneous currents. Barium (1 {\{}mM{\}}, local; 0.3-0.5 {\{}mM{\}}, bath) evoked a steady inward current, reduced the amplitude of instantaneous currents, and had only weak suppressive effects on Ih. 6. Block of Ih with local application of Cs+ resulted in a hyperpolarization of the membrane from the resting level, a decrease in apparent membrane conductance, and a block of the slow after-hyperpolarization that appears upon termination of depolarizing membrane responses, indicating that Ih contributes substantially to the resting and active membrane properties of thalamocortical relay neurones.({\{}ABSTRACT{\}} {\{}TRUNCATED{\}} {\{}AT{\}} 400 {\{}WORDS{\}})},

Recently, a remarkable new phenomenon, called "chimera states," has been described, where in a spatially homogeneous system, regions of irregular incoherent motion coexist with regular synchronized motion, forming a self-organized pattern in a population of nonlocally coupled oscillators. Whereas most previous studies of chimera states focused their attention on the case of large numbers of oscillators employing the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many oscillators, here we investigate the properties of chimera states in populations of finite size using concepts from deterministic chaos. Our calculations of the Lyapunov spectrum show that the incoherent motion, which is described in the thermodynamic limit as a stationary behavior, in finite size systems appears as weak spatially extensive chaos. Moreover, for sufficiently small populations the chimera states reveal their transient nature: after a certain time span we observe a sudden collapse of the chimera pattern and a transition to the completely coherent state. Our results indicate that chimera states can be considered as chaotic transients, showing the same properties as type-{\{}II{\}} supertransients in coupled map lattices.},

Assemblies of neurons transiently couple (integrate) and decouple (segregate) at multiple spatiotemporal scales; both integration and segregation are required to support metastability. Integration of distant brain regions can be achieved through long range excitatory projections, but the mechanism supporting long range segregation is not clear. We argue that the thalamocortical matrix connections, which project diffusely from the thalamus to the cortex and have long been thought to support cortical gain control, play an equally-important role in cortical segregation. We present a computational model of the diffuse thalamocortical loop, called the competitive cross-coupling (CXC) spiking network. Simulations of the model show how different levels of tonic input from the brainstem to the thalamus could control dynamical complexity in the cortex, directing transitions between sleep, wakefulness and high attention or vigilance. The model also explains how mutually-exclusive activity could arise across large portions of the cortex, such as between the default-mode and task-positive networks. It is robust to noise but does not require noise to autonomously generate metastability. We conclude that the long range segregation observed in brain activity and required for global metastable dynamics could be provided by the thalamocortical matrix, and is strongly modulated by brainstem input to the thalamus.},

Through an optimization process, it is possible to suppression the abnormal synchronization in the neural network.},

abstract = {This article presents, for the first time, a practical method for the direct quantification of frequency-specific synchronization (i.e., transient phase-locking) between two neuroelectric signals. The motivation for its development is to be able to examine the role of neural synchronies as a putative mechanism for long-range neural integration during cognitive tasks. The method, called phase-locking statistics ({\{}PLS{\}}), measures the significance of the phase covariance between two signals with a reasonable time-resolution ({\textless}100 ms). Unlike the more traditional method of spectral coherence, {\{}PLS{\}} separates the phase and amplitude components and can be directly interpreted in the framework of neural integration. To validate synchrony values against background fluctuations, {\{}PLS{\}} uses surrogate data and thus makes no a priori assumptions on the nature of the experimental data. We also apply {\{}PLS{\}} to investigate intracortical recordings from an epileptic patient performing a visual discrimination task. We find large-scale synchronies in the gamma band (45 Hz), e.g., between hippocampus and frontal gyrus, and local synchronies, within a limbic region, a few cm apart. We argue that whereas long-scale effects do reflect cognitive processing, short-scale synchronies are likely to be due to volume conduction. We discuss ways to separate such conduction effects from true signal synchrony.},

abstract = {Chimera states occur when identically coupled groups of nonlinear oscillators exhibit radically different dynamics, with one group exhibiting synchronized oscillations and the other desynchronized behavior. This dynamical phenomenon has recently been studied in computational models and demonstrated experimentally in mechanical, optical, and chemical systems. The theoretical basis of these states is currently under active investigation. Chimera behavior is of particular relevance in the context of neural synchronization, given the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep and the recent observation of asymmetric sleep in human patients with sleep apnea. The similarity of neural chimera states to neural "bump" states, which have been suggested as a model for working memory and visual orientation tuning in the cortex, adds to their interest as objects of study. Chimera states have been demonstrated in the FitzHugh- Nagumo model of excitable cells and in the Hindmarsh-Rose neural model. Here, we demonstrate chimera states and chimera-like behaviors in a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of thermally sensitive neurons both in a system with Abrams-Strogatz (mean field) coupling and in a system with Kuramoto (distance-dependent) coupling. We map the regions of parameter space for which chimera behavior occurs in each of the two coupling schemes. Published by AIP Publishing.},

@article{beimgraben_2019,
abstract = {Metastability refers to the fact that the state of a dynamical system spends a large amount of time in a restricted region of its available phase space before a transition takes place, bringing the system into another state from where it might recur into the previous one. beim Graben and Hutt (2013) suggested to use the recurrence plot (RP) technique introduced by Eckmann et al. (1987) for the segmentation of system's trajectories into metastable states using recurrence grammars. Here, we apply this recurrence structure analysis (RSA) for the first time to resting-state brain dynamics obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain regions are defined according to the brain hierarchical atlas (BHA) developed by Diez et al. (2015), and as a consequence, regions present high-connectivity in both structure (obtained from diffusion tensor imaging) and function (from the blood-level dependent-oxygenation—BOLD—signal). Remarkably, regions observed by Diez et al. were completely time-invariant. Here, in order to compare this static picture with the metastable systems dynamics obtained from the RSA segmentation, we determine the number of metastable states as a measure of complexity for all subjects and for region numbers varying from 3 to 100. We find RSA convergence toward an optimal segmentation of 40 metastable states for normalized BOLD signals, averaged over BHA modules. Next, we build a bistable dynamics at population level by pooling 30 subjects after Hausdorff clustering. In link with this finding, we reflect on the different modeling frameworks that can allow for such scenarios: heteroclinic dynamics, dynamics with riddled basins of attraction, multiple-timescale dynamics. Finally, we characterize the metastable states both functionally and structurally, using templates for resting state networks (RSNs) and the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas, respectively.},

abstract = {Local cortical circuits appear highly non-random, but the underlying connectivity rule remains elusive. Here, we analyze experimental data observed in layer 5 of rat neocortex and suggest a model for connectivity from which emerge essential observed non-random features of both wiring and weighting. These features include lognormal distributions of synaptic connection strength, anatomical clustering, and strong correlations between clustering and connection strength. Our model predicts that cortical microcircuits contain large groups of densely connected neurons which we call clusters. We show that such a cluster contains about one fifth of all excitatory neurons of a circuit which are very densely connected with stronger than average synapses. We demonstrate that such clustering plays an important role in the network dynamics, namely, it creates bistable neural spiking in small cortical circuits. Furthermore, introducing local clustering in large-scale networks leads to the emergence of various patterns of persistent local activity in an ongoing network activity. Thus, our results may bridge a gap between anatomical structure and persistent activity observed during working memory and other cognitive processes.},

All data were analyzed by two independent sites of experienced raters with the aforementioned software and the following {\{}WM{\}} tracts were reconstructed: corticospinal tract ({\{}CST{\}}); forceps major (Fmajor); forceps minor (Fminor); cingulum bundle ({\{}CB{\}}); superior longitudinal fasciculus ({\{}SLF{\}}); inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus ({\{}IFOF{\}}). Visual inspection of the resulted tracts and statistical analysis (inter-rater and betweensoftware agreement; paired t-test) on fractional anisotropy ({\{}FA{\}}), axial and radial diffusivity (Daxial, Dradial) were applied for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of {\{}DTI{\}} software results. {\{}RESULTS{\}}: Qualitative evaluation of the extracted tracts confirmed anatomical landmarks at least for the core part of each tract, even though differences in the number of fibers extracted and the whole tract were evident, especially for the {\{}CST{\}}, Fmajor, Fminor and {\{}SLF{\}}. Descriptive values did not deviate from the expected range of values for healthy adult population. Substantial inter-rater agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient [{\{}ICC{\}}], Bland-Altman analysis) was found for all tracts ({\{}ICC{\}}; {\{}FA{\}}: 0.839-0.989, Daxial: 0.704-0.991, Dradial: 0.972-0.993). Low agreement for {\{}FA{\}}, Daxial and Dradial ({\{}ICC{\}}; Bland-Altman analysis) and significant paired t-test differences (p {\textless}0.05) were detected regarding between-software agreement. {\{}CONCLUSIONS{\}}: Qualitative comparison of four different {\{}DTI{\}} software in addition to substantial inter-rater but poor between-software agreement highlight the differences on existing fiber tracking methodologies and several particularities of each {\{}WM{\}} tract, further supporting the need for further study in both clinical and research settings.},

abstract = {The complexity of many biological, social and technological systems stems from the richness of the interactions among their units. Over the past decades, a variety of complex systems has been successfully described as networks whose interacting pairs of nodes are connected by links. Yet, from human communications to chemical reactions and ecological systems, interactions can often occur in groups of three or more nodes and cannot be described simply in terms of dyads. Until recently little attention has been devoted to the higher-order architecture of real complex systems. However, a mounting body of evidence is showing that taking the higher-order structure of these systems into account can enhance our modeling capacities and help us understand and predict their dynamical behavior. Here we present a complete overview of the emerging field of networks beyond pairwise interactions. We discuss how to represent higher-order interactions and introduce the different frameworks used to describe higher-order systems, highlighting the links between the existing concepts and representations. We review the measures designed to characterize the structure of these systems and the models proposed to generate synthetic structures, such as random and growing bipartite graphs, hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. We introduce the rapidly growing research on higher-order dynamical systems and dynamical topology, discussing the relations between higher-order interactions and collective behavior. We focus in particular on new emergent phenomena characterizing dynamical processes, such as diffusion, synchronization, spreading, social dynamics and games, when extended beyond pairwise interactions. We conclude with a summary of empirical applications, and an outlook on current modeling and conceptual frontiers.},

abstract = {Activated neuronal groups typically engage in rhythmic synchronization in the gamma-frequency range (30-100 Hz). Experimental and modeling studies demonstrate that each gamma cycle is framed by synchronized spiking of inhibitory interneurons. Here, we review evidence suggesting that the resulting rhythmic network inhibition interacts with excitatory input to pyramidal cells such that the more excited cells fire earlier in the gamma cycle. Thus, the amplitude of excitatory drive is recoded into phase values of discharges relative to the gamma cycle. This recoding enables transmission and read out of amplitude information within a single gamma cycle without requiring rate integration. Furthermore, variation of phase relations can be exploited to facilitate or inhibit exchange of information between oscillating cell assemblies. The gamma cycle could thus serve as a fundamental computational mechanism for the implementation of a temporal coding scheme that enables fast processing and flexible routing of activity, supporting fast selection and binding of distributed responses.

By contrast, more recent approaches emphasize the constructive nature of perception, viewing it as an active and highly selective process. Indeed, there is ample evidence that the processing of stimuli is controlled by top-down influences that strongly shape the intrinsic dynamics of thalamocortical networks and constantly create predictions about forthcoming sensory events. We discuss recent experiments indicating that such predictions might be embodied in the temporal structure of both stimulus-evoked and ongoing activity, and that synchronous oscillations are particularly important in this process. Coherence among subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations could be exploited to express selective functional relationships during states of expectancy or attention, and these dynamic patterns could allow the grouping and selection of distributed neuronal responses for further processing.},

We use transfer entropy, an information theoretical measure, to quantify the exchanged information. We show that transferred information depends on the phase relation of the signal, that the amount of exchanged information increases as a function of oscillations in the signal and that the speed of the information transfer increases as a function of synchronization. This implies that synchronization makes information transport more efficient. In summary, our results reinforce the hypothesis that synchronization modulates neuronal interactions and provide further evidence that gamma band synchronization has behavioral relevance.},

We carry out a formal analysis of the strengths and limitations of three quantitative measures of dynamical complexity in the neural systems underlying consciousness: neural complexity, information integration, and causal density. We find that no single measure fully captures the multidimensional complexity of these systems, and all of these measures have practical limitations. Our analysis suggests guidelines for the specification of alternative measures which, in combination, may improve the quantitative characterization of conscious neural systems.

abstract = {Arousals can be roughly characterized by punctual intrusions of wakefulness into sleep. In a standard perspective, using human electroencephalography ({\{}EEG{\}}) data, arousals are associated to slow-wave rhythms and K-complex brain activity. The physiological mechanisms that give rise to arousals during sleep are not yet fully understood. Moreover, subtle body movement patterns, which may characterize arousals both in human and in animals, are usually not detectable by eye perception and are not in general present in sleep studies. In this paper, we focus attention on accelerometer records ({\{}AR{\}}) to characterize and predict arousal during slow wave sleep ({\{}SWS{\}}) stage of mice. Furthermore, we recorded the local field potentials ({\{}LFP{\}}) from the {\{}CA1{\}} region in the hippocampus and paired with accelerometer data. The hippocampus signal was also used here to identify the {\{}SWS{\}} stage. We analyzed the {\{}AR{\}} dynamics of consecutive arousals using recurrence technique and the determinism ({\{}DET{\}}) quantifier. Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterize time series properties. The {\{}DET{\}} index evaluates how similar are the evolution of close trajectories: in this sense, it computes how accurate are predictions based on past trajectories. For all analyzed mice in this work, we observed, for the first time, the occurrence of a universal dynamic pattern a few seconds that precedes the arousals during {\{}SWS{\}} sleep stage based only on the {\{}AR{\}} signal. The predictability success of an arousal using {\{}DET{\}} from {\{}AR{\}} is nearly 90{\%}, while similar analysis using {\{}LFP{\}} of hippocampus brain region reveal 88{\%} of success. Noteworthy, our findings suggest an unique dynamical behavior pattern preceding an arousal of {\{}AR{\}} data during sleep. Thus, the employment of this technique applied to {\{}AR{\}} data may provide useful information about the dynamics of neuronal activities that control sleep-waking switch during {\{}SWS{\}} sleep period. We argue that the predictability of arousals observed through {\{}DET{\}}({\{}AR{\}}) can be functionally explained by a respiratory-driven modification of neural states. Finally, we believe that the method associating {\{}AR{\}} data with other physiologic events such as neural rhythms can become an accurate, convenient and non-invasive way of studying the physiology and physiopathology of movement and respiratory processes during sleep.},

abstract = {I propose that synchronization affects communication between neuronal groups. Gamma-band (30-90 Hz) synchronization modulates excitation rapidly enough that it escapes the following inhibition and activates postsynaptic neurons effectively. Synchronization also ensures that a presynaptic activation pattern arrives at postsynaptic neurons in a temporally coordinated manner. At a postsynaptic neuron, multiple presynaptic groups converge, e.g., representing different stimuli. If a stimulus is selected by attention, its neuronal representation shows stronger and higher-frequency gamma-band synchronization. Thereby, the attended stimulus representation selectively entrains postsynaptic neurons. The entrainment creates sequences of short excitation and longer inhibition that are coordinated between pre- and postsynaptic groups to transmit the attended representation and shut out competing inputs. The predominantly bottom-up-directed gamma-band influences are controlled by predominantly top-down-directed alpha-beta-band (8-20 Hz) influences. Attention itself samples stimuli at a 7-8 Hz theta rhythm. Thus, several rhythms and their interplay render neuronal communication effective, precise, and selective.

The signals between neurons and glia include ion fluxes, neurotransmitters, cell adhesion molecules, and specialized signaling molecules released from synaptic and nonsynaptic regions of the neuron. In contrast to the serial flow of information along chains of neurons, glia communicate with other glial cells through intracellular waves of calcium and via intercellular diffusion of chemical messengers. By releasing neurotransmitters and other extracellular signaling molecules, glia can affect neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission and perhaps coordinate activity across networks of neurons.},

abstract = {Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a "high-input regime" in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50-100 neurons. These column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10-50 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons-that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.},

Phase synchronization - here referring to the synchronization of oscillatory phases between different brain regions - supports both working memory and long-term memory and acts by facilitating neural communication and by promoting neural plasticity. There is evidence that processes underlying working and long-term memory might interact in the medial temporal lobe. We propose that this is accomplished by neural operations involving phase-phase and phase-amplitude synchronization. A deeper understanding of how phase synchronization supports the flexibility of and interaction between memory systems may yield new insights into the functions of phase synchronization in general.},

abstract = {Brain hemodynamics serve as a proxy for neural activity in a range of noninvasive neuroimaging techniques including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In resting-state fMRI, hemodynamic fluctuations have been found to exhibit patterns of bilateral synchrony, with correlated regions inferred to have functional connectivity. However, the relationship between resting-state hemodynamics and underlying neural activity has not been well established, making the neural underpinnings of functional connectivity networks unclear. In this study, neural activity and hemodynamics were recorded simultaneously over the bilateral cortex of awake and anesthetized Thy1-GCaMP mice using wide-field optical mapping. Neural activity was visualized via selective expression of the calcium-sensitive fluorophore GCaMP in layer 2/3 and 5 excitatory neurons. Characteristic patterns of resting-state hemodynamics were accompanied by more rapidly changing bilateral patterns of resting-state neural activity. Spatiotemporal hemodynamics could be modeled by convolving this neural activity with hemodynamic response functions derived through both deconvolution and gamma-variate fitting. Simultaneous imaging and electrophysiology confirmed that Thy1-GCaMP signals are well-predicted by multiunit activity. Neurovascular coupling between resting-state neural activity and hemodynamics was robust and fast in awake animals, whereas coupling in urethane-anesthetized animals was slower, and in some cases included lower-frequency ({\textless}0.04 Hz) hemodynamic fluctuations that were not well-predicted by local Thy1-GCaMP recordings. These results support that resting-state hemodynamics in the awake and anesthetized brain are coupled to underlying patterns of excitatory neural activity. The patterns of bilaterally-symmetric spontaneous neural activity revealed by widefield Thy1-GCaMP imaging may depict the neural foundation of functional connectivity networks detected in resting-state fMRI.},

Accumulating evidence suggests that this selective neuronal modulation relies on rhythmic synchronization at local and long-range spatial scales: attention selectively synchronizes the rhythmic responses of those neurons that are tuned to the spatial and featural attributes of the attended sensory input. The strength of synchronization is thereby functionally related to perceptual accuracy and behavioural efficiency. Complementing this synchronization at a local level, attention has recently been demonstrated to regulate which locally synchronized neuronal groups phase-synchronize their rhythmic activity across long-range connections. These results point to a general computational role for selective synchronization in dynamically controlling which neurons communicate information about sensory inputs effectively.},

abstract = {An important idea in neural information processing is the communication-through-coherence hypothesis, according to which communication between two brain regions is effective only if they are phase-locked. Also of importance is neuronal variability, a phenomenon in which a single neuron's inter-firing times may be highly variable. In this work, we aim to connect these two ideas by studying the effects of that variability on the capability of neurons to reach phase synchronization. We simulate a network of modified-Hodgkin-Huxley-bursting neurons possessing a small-world topology. First, variability is shown to be correlated with the average degree of phase synchronization of the network. Next, restricting to spatial variability - which measures the deviation of firing times between all neurons in the network - we show that it is positively correlated to a behavior we call promiscuity, which is the tendency of neurons to to have their relative phases change with time. This relation is observed in all cases we tested, regardless of the degree of synchronization or the strength of the inter-neuronal coupling: high variability implies high promiscuity (low duration of phase-locking), even if the network as a whole is synchronized and the coupling is strong. We argue that spatial variability actually generates promiscuity. Therefore, we conclude that variability has a strong influence on both the degree and the manner in which neurons phase synchronize, which is another reason for its relevance in neural communication.},

abstract = {We studied the synchronous behavior of two electrically-coupled model neurons as a function of the coupling strength when the individual neurons are tuned to different activity patterns that ranged from tonic firing via chaotic activity to burst discharges. We observe asynchronous and various synchronous states such as out-of-phase, in-phase and almost in-phase chaotic synchronization. The highest variety of synchronous states occurs at the transition from tonic firing to chaos where the highest coupling strength is also needed for in-phase synchronization which is, essentially, facilitated towards the bursting range. This demonstrates that tuning of the neuron's internal dynamics can have significant impact on the synchronous states especially at the physiologically relevant tonic-to-bursting transitions.},

abstract = {It is well established that the variability of the neural activity across trials, as measured by the Fano factor, is elevated. This fact poses limits on information encoding by the neural activity. However, a series of recent neurophysiological experiments have changed this traditional view. Single cell recordings across a variety of species, brain areas, brain states and stimulus conditions demonstrate a remarkable reduction of the neural variability when an external stimulation is applied and when attention is allocated towards a stimulus within a neuron's receptive field, suggesting an enhancement of information encoding. Using an heterogeneously connected neural network model whose dynamics exhibits multiple attractors, we demonstrate here how this variability reduction can arise from a network effect. In the spontaneous state, we show that the high degree of neural variability is mainly due to fluctuation-driven excursions from attractor to attractor. This occurs when, in the parameter space, the network working point is around the bifurcation allowing multistable attractors. The application of an external excitatory drive by stimulation or attention stabilizes one specific attractor, eliminating in this way the transitions between the different attractors and resulting in a net decrease in neural variability over trials. Importantly, non-responsive neurons also exhibit a reduction of variability. Finally, this reduced variability is found to arise from an increased regularity of the neural spike trains. In conclusion, these results suggest that the variability reduction under stimulation and attention is a property of neural circuits.},

abstract = {The idea that cognitive activity can be understood using nonlinear dynamics has been intensively discussed at length for the last 15 years. One of the popular points of view is that metastable states play a key role in the execution of cognitive functions. Experimental and modeling studies suggest that most of these functions are the result of transient activity of large-scale brain networks in the presence of noise. Such transients may consist of a sequential switching between different metastable cognitive states. The main problem faced when using dynamical theory to describe transient cognitive processes is the fundamental contradiction between reproducibility and flexibility of transient behavior. In this paper, we propose a theoretical description of transient cognitive dynamics based on the interaction of functionally dependent metastable cognitive states. The mathematical image of such transient activity is a stable heteroclinic channel, i.e., a set of trajectories in the vicinity of a heteroclinic skeleton that consists of saddles and unstable separatrices that connect their surroundings. We suggest a basic mathematical model, a strongly dissipative dynamical system, and formulate the conditions for the robustness and reproducibility of cognitive transients that satisfy the competing requirements for stability and flexibility. Based on this approach, we describe here an effective solution for the problem of sequential decision making, represented as a fixed time game: a player takes sequential actions in a changing noisy environment so as to maximize a cumulative reward. As we predict and verify in computer simulations, noise plays an important role in optimizing the gain. {\textcopyright} 2008 Rabinovich et al.},

Optogenetically driving fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive ({\{}FS{\}}-{\{}PV{\}})-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, reduces levels of amyloid-$\beta$(A$\beta$)1-40 and A$\beta$1-42 isoforms. Gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological transformation of microglia, and histological analysis confirmed increased microglia co-localization with A$\beta$. Subsequently, we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced A$\beta$1-40 and A$\beta$1-42 levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma rhythms in recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate Alzheimer's-disease-associated pathology.},

In this paper, the cerebral cortex is described as a network of networks (cortex network), we consider that each cortical area is composed of a network with small-world property (cortical network). The neurons are assumed to have bursting properties with the dynamics described by the Rulkov model. We study the phase synchronization of the cortex network and the cortical networks. In our simulations, we verify that synchronization in cortex network is not homogeneous. Besides, we focus on the suppression of neural phase synchronization. Synchronization can be related to undesired and pathological abnormal rhythms in the brain. For this reason, we consider the delayed feedback control to suppress the synchronization. We show that delayed feedback control is efficient to suppress synchronous behavior in our network model when an appropriate signal intensity and time delay are defined.},

abstract = {Error-related activity in the medial prefrontal cortex ({\{}mPFC{\}}) is thought to work in conjunction with lateral prefrontal cortex ({\{}lPFC{\}}) as a part of an action-monitoring network, where errors signal the need for increased cognitive control. The neural mechanism by which this {\{}mPFC{\}}-{\{}lPFC{\}} interaction occurs remains unknown. We hypothesized that transient synchronous oscillations in the theta range reflect a mechanism by which these structures interact. To test this hypothesis, we extracted oscillatory phase and power from current-source-density-transformed electroencephalographic data recorded during a Flanker task. Theta power in the {\{}mPFC{\}} was diminished on the trial preceding an error and increased immediately after an error, consistent with predictions of an action-monitoring system. These power dynamics appeared to take place over a response-related background of oscillatory theta phase coherence. Theta phase synchronization between {\{}FCz{\}} ({\{}mPFC{\}}) and F5/6 ({\{}lPFC{\}}) sites was robustly increased during error trials. The degree of {\{}mPFC{\}}-{\{}lPFC{\}} oscillatory synchronization predicted the degree of {\{}mPFC{\}} power on error trials, and both of these dynamics predicted the degree of posterror reaction time slowing. Oscillatory dynamics in the theta band may in part underlie a mechanism of communication between networks involved in action monitoring and cognitive control.},

Simulations of growth explain a wide range of anatomical observations for columnar and non-columnar cortex, superficial patch connections, and the organization and dynamic interactions of neurone response properties. An antenatal scaffold is created, upon which postnatal learning can establish continuously ordered neuronal representations, permitting matching of co-synchronous fields in multiple cortical areas to solve optimization problems as in Dynamic Logic. Fast synaptic competition partitions equilibria, minimizing "the curse of dimensionality", while perturbations between imperfectly partitioned synchronous fields, under internal reinforcement, enable the cortex to become adaptively self-directed.

One of the most important transitions in neuronal response patterns is the transition from tonic firing to burst discharges, i.e., when the neuronal activity changes from single spikes to the grouping of spikes. An increased number of interspike-interval sequences of specific temporal correlations was detected in anticipation of temperature induced tonic-to-bursting transitions in both, experimental impulse recordings from hypothalamic brain slices and numerical simulations of a stochastic model. Analysis of the modelling data elucidates that the appearance of such patterns can be related to particular system dynamics in the vicinity of the period-doubling bifurcation. It leads to a nonlinear response on de- and hyperpolarizing perturbations introduced by noise. This explains why such particular patterns can be found as reliable precursors of the neurons' transition to burst discharges.},

Such a representation brings connectomic data into the realm of graph theory, affording a rich repertoire of mathematical tools and concepts that can be used to characterize diverse anatomical and dynamical properties of brain networks. Although this approach has tremendous potential - and has seen rapid uptake in the neuroimaging community - it also has a number of pitfalls and unresolved challenges which can, if not approached with due caution, undermine the explanatory potential of the endeavor.

abstract = {We present an ionic conductance model of chattering neurons in the neocortex, which fire fast rhythmic bursts in the gamma frequency range (approximately 40 Hz) in response to stimulation [Gray C. M. and {\{}McCormick{\}} D. A. (1996) Science 274, 109-113]. The bursting mechanism involves a "ping-pong" interplay between soma-to-dendrite back propagation of action potentials and an afterdepolarization generated by a persistent dendritic Na+ current and a somatic Na+ window current. The oscillation period is primarily determined by a slowly inactivating K+ channel and passive membrane properties. The model behavior is compared quantitatively with the experimental data. It is shown that the cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation can transform the model cell's firing pattern from tonic spiking to rapid bursting, as a possible pathway for acetylcholine to promote 40-Hz oscillations in the visual cortex. To explore possible functions of fast burst firing in the neocortex, a hypothetical neural pair is simulated, where a chattering cell is presynaptic to an inhibitory interneuron via stochastic synapses. For this purpose, we use a synapse model endowed with a low release probability, short-term facilitation and vesicle depletion. This synapse model reproduces the behavior of certain neocortical pyramid-to-interneuron synapses [Thomson A. M. et al. (1993) Neuroscience 54, 347-360]. We showed that the burstiness of cell firing is required for the rhythmicity to be reliably transmitted to the postsynaptic cell via unreliable synapses, and that fast burst firing of chattering neurons can provide an exceptionally powerful drive for recruiting feedback inhibition in cortical circuits. From these results, we propose that the fast rhythmic burst firing of neocortical chattering neurons is generated by a calcium-independent ionic mechanism. Our simulation results on the neural pair highlight the importance of characterizing the short-term plasticity of the synaptic connections made by chattering cells, in order to understand their putative pacemaker role in synchronized gamma oscillations of the visual cortex.},

abstract = {Spontaneous brain activity at rest is spatially and temporally organized in networks of cortical and subcortical regions specialized for different functional domains. Even though brain networks were first studied individually through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, more recent studies focused on their dynamic 'integration'. Integration depends on two fundamental properties: the structural topology of brain networks and the dynamics of functional connectivity. In this scenario, cortical hub regions, that are central regions highly connected with other areas of the brain, play a fundamental role in serving as way stations for network traffic. In this review, we focus on the functional organization of a set of hub areas that we define as the 'dynamic core'. In the resting state, these regions dynamically interact with other regions of the brain linking multiple networks. First, we introduce and compare the statistical measures used for detecting hubs. Second, we discuss their identification based on different methods (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Diffusion Weighted Imaging, Electro/Magneto Encephalography). Third, we show that the degree of interaction between these core regions and the rest of the brain varies over time, indicating that their centrality is not stationary. Moreover, alternating periods of strong and weak centrality of the core relate to periods of strong and weak global efficiency in the brain. These results indicate that information processing in the brain is not stable, but fluctuates and its temporal and spectral properties are discussed. In particular, the hypothesis of 'pulsed' information processing, discovered in the slow temporal scale, is explored for signals at higher temporal resolution.

abstract = {Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls.},

One possible explanation is that robust dynamics are facilitated by homeostatic mechanisms that can dynamically rebalance brain networks. In this study, we simulate a cortical brain network using the Wil-son-Cowan neural mass model with conduction delays and noise, and use inhibitory synap-tic plasticity (ISP) to dynamically achieve a spatially local balance between excitation and inhibition. Using MEG data from 55 subjects we find that ISP enables us to simultaneously achieve high correlation with multiple measures of functional connectivity, including amplitude envelope correlation and phase locking. Further, we find that ISP successfully achieves local E/I balance, and can consistently predict the functional connectivity computed from real MEG data, for a much wider range of model parameters than is possible with a model without ISP.},

abstract = {In the last decade, there has been a growing body of literature addressing the utilization of complex network methods for the characterization of dynamical systems based on time series. While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems. The overall aim of this report is to provide the readers with the knowledge how the complex network approaches can be applied to their own field of real-world time series analysis.},

abstract = {Spatial patterns of coherent activity across different brain areas have been identified during the resting-state fluctuations of the brain. However, recent studies indicate that resting-state activity is not stationary, but shows complex temporal dynamics. We were interested in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the phase interactions among resting-state fMRI BOLD signals from human subjects. We found that the global phase synchrony of the BOLD signals evolves on a characteristic ultra-slow ({\textless}0.01Hz) time scale, and that its temporal variations reflect the transient formation and dissolution of multiple communities of synchronized brain regions. Synchronized communities reoccurred intermittently in time and across scanning sessions. We found that the synchronization communities relate to previously defined functional networks known to be engaged in sensory-motor or cognitive function, called resting-state networks (RSNs), including the default mode network, the somato-motor network, the visual network, the auditory network, the cognitive control networks, the self-referential network, and combinations of these and other RSNs. We studied the mechanism originating the observed spatiotemporal synchronization dynamics by using a network model of phase oscillators connected through the brain's anatomical connectivity estimated using diffusion imaging human data. The model consistently approximates the temporal and spatial synchronization patterns of the empirical data, and reveals that multiple clusters that transiently synchronize and desynchronize emerge from the complex topology of anatomical connections, provided that oscillators are heterogeneous.},

To generate realistic results, synapse-specific Hebbian forms of plasticity, such as long-term potentiation and depression, must be augmented by global processes that regulate overall levels of neuronal and network activity. Regulatory processes are often as important as the more intensively studied Hebbian processes in determining the consequences of synaptic plasticity for network function. Recent experimental results suggest several novel mechanisms for regulating levels of activity in conjunction with Hebbian synaptic modification. We review three of them—synaptic scaling, spike-timing dependent plasticity and synaptic redistribution—and discuss their functional implications.},

abstract = {The Julia programming language is gaining enormous popularity. Julia was designed to be easy and fast. Most importantly, Julia shatters deeply established notions widely held in the applied community: 1. High-level, dynamic code has to be slow by some sort of law of nature 2. It is sensible to prototype in one language and then recode in another language 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. Julia began with a deep understanding of the needs of the scientic programmer and the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from computer science and computational science creating a new approach to scientic computing. This note introduces the programmer to the language and the underlying design theory. It invites the reader to rethink the fundamental foundations of numerical computing systems. In particular, there is the fascinating dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. We can pick just the right algorithm for the right circumstance and this can happen at runtime based on argument types (code selection via multiple dispatch). Abstraction recognizes what remains the same after dierences are stripped away and ignored as irrelevant. The recognition of abstraction allows for code reuse (generic programming). A simple idea that yields incredible power. The Julia design facilitates this interplay in many explicit and subtle ways for machine performance and, most importantly, human convenience.},

abstract = {The brain can be regarded as a network: a connected system where nodes, or units, represent different specialized regions and links, or connections, represent communication pathways. From a functional perspective, communication is coded by temporal dependence between the activities of different brain areas. In the last decade, the abstract representation of the brain as a graph has allowed to visualize functional brain networks and describe their non-trivial topological properties in a compact and objective way. Nowadays, the use of graph analysis in translational neuroscience has become essential to quantify brain dysfunctions in terms of aberrant reconfiguration of functional brain networks. Despite its evident impact, graph analysis of functional brain networks is not a simple toolbox that can be blindly applied to brain signals. On the one hand, it requires the know-how of all the methodological steps of the pipeline that manipulate the input brain signals and extract the functional network properties. On the other hand, knowledge of the neural phenomenon under study is required to perform physiologically relevant analysis.

abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and {\{}fMRI{\}} experiments. Finally, the authors consider the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain systems.},

abstract = {Visually induced neuronal activity in V1 displays a marked gamma-band component which is modulated by stimulus properties. It has been argued that synchronized oscillations contribute to these gamma-band activity. However, analysis of Local Field Potentials ({\{}LFPs{\}}) across different experiments reveals considerable diversity in the degree of oscillatory behavior of this induced activity. Contrast-dependent power enhancements can indeed occur over a broad band in the gamma frequency range and spectral peaks may not arise at all. Furthermore, even when oscillations are observed, they undergo temporal decorrelation over very few cycles. This is not easily accounted for in previous network modeling of gamma oscillations. We argue here that interactions between cortical layers can be responsible for this fast decorrelation. We study a model of a V1 hypercolumn, embedding a simplified description of the multi-layered structure of the cortex. When the stimulus contrast is low, the induced activity is only weakly synchronous and the network resonates transiently without developing collective oscillations. When the contrast is high, on the other hand, the induced activity undergoes synchronous oscillations with an irregular spatiotemporal structure expressing a synchronous chaotic state. As a consequence the population activity undergoes fast temporal decorrelation, with concomitant rapid damping of the oscillations in {\{}LFPs{\}} autocorrelograms and peak broadening in {\{}LFPs{\}} power spectra. We show that the strength of the inter-layer coupling crucially affects this spatiotemporal structure. We predict that layer {\{}VI{\}} inactivation should induce global changes in the spectral properties of induced {\{}LFPs{\}}, reflecting their slower temporal decorrelation in the absence of inter-layer feedback. Finally, we argue that the mechanism underlying the emergence of synchronous chaos in our model is in fact very general. It stems from the fact that gamma oscillations induced by local delayed inhibition tend to develop chaos when coupled by sufficiently strong excitation.},

A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

abstract = {{\{}PURPOSE{\}}: To assess intrinsic properties of water diffusion in normal human brain by using quantitative parameters derived from the diffusion tensor, D, which are insensitive to patient orientation. {\{}MATERIALS{\}} {\{}AND{\}} {\{}METHODS{\}}: Maps of the principal diffusivities of D, of Trace(D), and of diffusion anisotropy indices were calculated in eight healthy adults from 31 multisection, interleaved echo-planar diffusion-weighted images acquired in about 25 minutes. {\{}RESULTS{\}}: No statistically significant differences in Trace(D) (approximately 2,100 x 10(-6) mm2/sec) were found within normal brain parenchyma, except in the cortex, where Trace(D) was higher. Diffusion anisotropy varied widely among different white matter regions, reflecting differences in fiber-tract architecture. In the corpus callosum and pyramidal tracts, the ratio of parallel to perpendicular diffusivities was approximately threefold higher than previously reported, and diffusion appeared cylindrically symmetric. However, in other white matter regions, particularly in the centrum semiovale, diffusion anisotropy was low, and cylindrical symmetry was not observed. Maps of parameters derived from D were also used to segment tissues based on their diffusion properties. {\{}CONCLUSION{\}}: A quantitative characterization of water diffusion in anisotropic, heterogeneously oriented tissues is clinically feasible. This should improve the neuroradiologic assessment of a variety of gray and white matter disorders.},

abstract = {Subliminal stimuli can be deeply processed and activate similar brain areas as consciously perceived stimuli. This raises the question which signatures of neural activity critically differentiate conscious from unconscious processing. Transient synchronization of neural activity has been proposed as a neural correlate of conscious perception. Here we test this proposal by comparing the electrophysiological responses related to the processing of visible and invisible words in a delayed matching to sample task. Both perceived and nonperceived words caused a similar increase of local (gamma) oscillations in the {\{}EEG{\}}, but only perceived words induced a transient long-distance synchronization of gamma oscillations across widely separated regions of the brain. After this transient period of temporal coordination, the electrographic signatures of conscious and unconscious processes continue to diverge. Only words reported as perceived induced (1) enhanced theta oscillations over frontal regions during the maintenance interval, (2) an increase of the P300 component of the event-related potential, and (3) an increase in power and phase synchrony of gamma oscillations before the anticipated presentation of the test word. We propose that the critical process mediating the access to conscious perception is the early transient global increase of phase synchrony of oscillatory activity in the gamma frequency range.},

To test whether, as has been suggested, this high in vivo variability could be due to the postsynaptic currents generated by independent synaptic inputs, we injected synthetic synaptic current into neocortical neurons in brain slices. We report that independent inputs cannot account for this high variability, but this variability can be explained by a simple alternative model of the synaptic drive in which inputs arrive synchronously. Our results suggest that synchrony may be important in the neural code by providing a means for encoding signals with high temporal fidelity over a population of neurons.},

abstract = {Slowness of thought is not necessarily a handicap but could be a signature of optimal brain function. Emerging evidence shows that neuroanatomical and dynamical constraints of the human brain shape its functionality in optimal ways, characterized by slowness during task-based cognition in the context of spontaneous resting-state activity. This activity can be described mechanistically by whole-brain computational modeling that relates directly to optimality in the context of theories arguing for metastability in the brain. We discuss the role for optimal processing of information in the context of cognitive, task-related activity, and propose that combining multi-modal neuroimaging and explicit whole-brain models focused on the timing of functional dynamics can help to uncover fundamental rules of brain function in health and disease. The dynamics of the human brain exhibits 'slowness' during spontaneous activity and task-based cognition.Whole-brain computational modeling can account for the mechanisms underlying this slowness in terms of maximal metastability of the dynamical system.A better understanding of the balance between fast and slow brain processing could lead to fundamental new insights into the brain in health and disease.},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence indicate that brief ({\textless}25 ms) bursts of high-frequency firing have special importance in brain function. Recent work shows that many central synapses are surprisingly unreliable at signaling the arrival of single presynaptic action potentials to the postsynaptic neuron. However, bursts are reliably signaled because transmitter release is facilitated. Thus, these synapses can be viewed as filters that transmit bursts, but filter out single spikes. Bursts appear to have a special role in synaptic plasticity and information processing. In the hippocampus, a single burst can produce long-term synaptic modifications. In brain structures whose computational role is known, action potentials that arrive in bursts provide more-precise information than action potentials that arrive singly. These results, and the requirement for multiple inputs to fire a cell suggest that the best stimulus for exciting a cell (that is, a neural code) is coincident bursts.},

Experimental findings imply that most of the brain's computations can be performed in a non-conscious mode, but that conscious perception is characterized by an amplification, global propagation and integration of brain signals. A comparison of these data with major theoretical proposals suggests that firstly, conscious access must be carefully distinguished from selective attention; secondly, conscious perception may be likened to a non-linear decision that 'ignites' a network of distributed areas; thirdly, information which is selected for conscious perception gains access to additional computations, including temporary maintenance, global sharing, and flexible routing; and finally, measures of the complexity, long-distance correlation and integration of brain signals provide reliable indices of conscious processing, clinically relevant to patients recovering from coma.

abstract = {Despite recent interest in reconstructing neuronal networks, complete wiring diagrams on the level of individual synapses remain scarce and the insights into function they can provide remain unclear. Even for Caenorhabditis elegans, whose neuronal network is relatively small and stereotypical from animal to animal, published wiring diagrams are neither accurate nor complete and self-consistent. Using materials from White et al. and new electron micrographs we assemble whole, self-consistent gap junction and chemical synapse networks of hermaphrodite C. elegans. We propose a method to visualize the wiring diagram, which reflects network signal flow. We calculate statistical and topological properties of the network, such as degree distributions, synaptic multiplicities, and small-world properties, that help in understanding network signal propagation. We identify neurons that may play central roles in information processing, and network motifs that could serve as functional modules of the network. We explore propagation of neuronal activity in response to sensory or artificial stimulation using linear systems theory and find several activity patterns that could serve as substrates of previously described behaviors. Finally, we analyze the interaction between the gap junction and the chemical synapse networks. Since several statistical properties of the C. elegans network, such as multiplicity and motif distributions are similar to those found in mammalian neocortex, they likely point to general principles of neuronal networks. The wiring diagram reported here can help in understanding the mechanistic basis of behavior by generating predictions about future experiments involving genetic perturbations, laser ablations, or monitoring propagation of neuronal activity in response to stimulation.},

abstract = {Functional connectivity ({\{}FC{\}}) sheds light on the interactions between different brain regions. Besides basic research, it is clinically relevant for applications in Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, presurgical planning, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury. Simulations of whole-brain mean-field computational models with realistic connectivity determined by tractography studies enable us to reproduce with accuracy aspects of average {\{}FC{\}} in the resting state. Most computational studies, however, did not address the prominent non-stationarity in resting state {\{}FC{\}}, which may result in large intra- and inter-subject variability and thus preclude an accurate individual predictability. Here we show that this non-stationarity reveals a rich structure, characterized by rapid transitions switching between a few discrete {\{}FC{\}} states. We also show that computational models optimized to fit time-averaged {\{}FC{\}} do not reproduce these spontaneous state transitions and, thus, are not qualitatively superior to simplified linear stochastic models, which account for the effects of structure alone. We then demonstrate that a slight enhancement of the non-linearity of the network nodes is sufficient to broaden the repertoire of possible network behaviors, leading to modes of fluctuations, reminiscent of some of the most frequently observed Resting State Networks. Because of the noise-driven exploration of this repertoire, the dynamics of {\{}FC{\}} qualitatively change now and display non-stationary switching similar to empirical resting state recordings (Functional Connectivity Dynamics ({\{}FCD{\}})).

Dynamic instability is a form of complexity, typical of neuronal systems, which may be crucial for adaptive brain function from two perspectives. The first is from the point of view of neuronal selection and self-organizing systems: if selective mechanisms underpin the emergence of adaptive neuronal responses then dynamic instability is, itself, necessarily adaptive. This is because dynamic instability is the source of diversity on which selection acts and is therefore subject to selective pressure. In short, the emergence of order, through selection, depends almost paradoxically on the instabilities that characterize the diversity of brain dynamics. The second perspective is provided by information theory.},

We analyze the complex synchronization scenario depicted by the network as a function of internal and external coupling parameters. Particularly, we identify regions of non-monotonic dependence of the synchronization level as a function of the coupling strength; coupling induced phase desynchronization ({\{}PD{\}}), where the synchronization levels are similar to those expected for randomly distributed phases; almost complete spike synchronization ({\{}$\backslash$SS{\}}) for which even spikes composing a burst are synchronized.

In every case, stimulus onset caused a decline in neural variability. This occurred even when the stimulus produced little change in mean firing rate. The variability decline was observed in membrane potential recordings, in the spiking of individual neurons and in correlated spiking variability measured with implanted 96-electrode arrays. The variability decline was observed for all stimuli tested, regardless of whether the animal was awake, behaving or anaesthetized. This widespread variability decline suggests a rather general property of cortex, that its state is stabilized by an input.},

abstract = {The hypothesis that brain organization is based on mechanisms of metastable synchronization in neural assemblies has been popularized during the last decades of neuroscientific research. Nevertheless, the role of body and environment for understanding the functioning of metastable assemblies is frequently dismissed. The main goal of this paper is to investigate the contribution of sensorimotor coupling to neural and behavioral metastability using a minimal computational model of plastic neural ensembles embedded in a robotic agent in a behavioral preference task. Our hypothesis is that, under some conditions, the metastability of the system is not restricted to the brain but extends to the system composed by the interaction of brain, body and environment. We test this idea, comparing an agent in continuous interaction with its environment in a task demanding behavioral flexibility with an equivalent model from the point of view of “internalist neuroscience.” A statistical characterization of our model and tools from information theory allow us to show how (1) the bidirectional coupling between agent and environment brings the system closer to a regime of criticality and triggers the emergence of additional metastable states which are not found in the brain in isolation but extended to the whole system of sensorimotor interaction, (2) the synaptic plasticity of the agent is fundamental to sustain open structures in the neural controller of the agent flexibly engaging and disengaging different behavioral patterns that sustain sensorimotor metastable states, and (3) these extended metastable states emerge when the agent generates an asymmetrical circular loop of causal interaction with its environment, in which the agent responds to variability of the environment at fast timescales while acting over the environment at slow timescales, suggesting the constitution of the agent as an autonomous entity actively modulating its sensorimotor coupling with the world. We conclude with a reflection about how our results contribute in a more general way to current progress in neuroscientific research.},

abstract = {Brain connectomes are topologically complex systems, anatomically embedded in {\{}3D{\}} space. Anatomical conservation of "wiring cost" explains many but not all aspects of these networks. Here, we examined the relationship between topology and wiring cost in the mouse connectome by using data from 461 systematically acquired anterograde-tracer injections into the right cortical and subcortical regions of the mouse brain. We estimated brain-wide weights, distances, and wiring costs of axonal projections and performed a multiscale topological and spatial analysis of the resulting weighted and directed mouse brain connectome. Our analysis showed that the mouse connectome has small-world properties, a hierarchical modular structure, and greater-than-minimal wiring costs. High-participation hubs of this connectome mediated communication between functionally specialized and anatomically localized modules, had especially high wiring costs, and closely corresponded to regions of the default mode network. Analyses of independently acquired histological and gene-expression data showed that nodal participation colocalized with low neuronal density and high expression of genes enriched for cognition, learning and memory, and behavior. The mouse connectome contains high-participation hubs, which are not explained by wiring-cost minimization but instead reflect competitive selection pressures for integrated network topology as a basis for higher cognitive and behavioral functions.},

abstract = {The brain is perhaps the most advanced and robust computation system known. We are creating a method to study how information is processed and encoded in living cultured neuronal networks by interfacing them to a computer-generated animal, the Neurally-Controlled Animat, within a virtual world. Cortical neurons from rats are dissociated and cultured on a surface containing a grid of electrodes (multi-electrode arrays, or {\{}MEAs{\}}) capable of both recording and stimulating neural activity. Distributed patterns of neural activity are used to control the behavior of the Animat in a simulated environment. The computer acts as its sensory system providing electrical feedback to the network about the Animat's movement within its environment. Changes in the Animat's behavior due to interaction with its surroundings are studied in concert with the biological processes (e.g., neural plasticity) that produced those changes, to understand how information is processed and encoded within a living neural network. Thus, we have created a hybrid real-time processing engine and control system that consists of living, electronic, and simulated components. Eventually this approach may be applied to controlling robotic devices, or lead to better real-time silicon-based information processing and control algorithms that are fault tolerant and can repair themselves.},

In the current paper, we present an update of the status of this hypothesis through summarizing recent results from our laboratory that suggest important new insights regarding the mechanisms, function and relevance of this phenomenon. In the first part, we present recent results derived from animal experiments and mathematical simulations that provide novel explanations and mechanisms for zero and nero-zero phase lag synchronization. In the second part, we shall discuss the role of neural synchrony for expectancy during perceptual organization and its role in conscious experience. This will be followed by evidence that indicates that in addition to supporting conscious cognition, neural synchrony is abnormal in major brain disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. We conclude this paper with suggestions for further research as well as with critical issues that need to be addressed in future studies.},

abstract = {An in vivo preparation has been developed to study the mechanisms underlying spontaneous sleep oscillations. Dual and triple simultaneous intracellular recordings were made from neurons in small isolated cortical slabs (10 mm x 6 mm) in anesthetized cats. Spontaneously occurring slow sleep oscillations, present in the adjacent intact cortex, were absent in small slabs. However, the isolated slabs displayed brief active periods separated by long periods of silence, up to 60 s in duration. During these silent periods, 60{\%} of neurons showed non-linear amplification of low-amplitude depolarizing activity. Nearly 40{\%} of the cells, twice as many as in intact cortex, were classified as intrinsically bursting. In cortical network models based on Hodgkin-Huxley-like neurons, the summation of simulated spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials was sufficient to activate a persistent sodium current, initiating action potentials in single neurons that then spread through the network. Consistent with this model, enlarging the isolated cortical territory to an isolated gyrus (30 mm x 20 mm) increased the probability of initiating large-scale activity. In these larger territories, both the frequency and regularity of the slow oscillation approached that generated in intact cortex. The frequency of active periods in an analytical model of the cortical network accurately predicted the scaling observed in simulations and from recordings in cortical slabs of increasing size.},

abstract = {The dynamics of the environment where we live in and the interaction with it, predicting events, provided strong evolutionary pressures for the brain functioning to process temporal information and generate timed responses. As a result, the human brain is able to process temporal information and generate temporal patterns. Despite the clear importance of temporal processing to cognition, learning, communication and sensory, motor and emotional processing, the basal mechanisms of how animals differentiate simple intervals or provide timed responses are still under debate. The lesson we learned from the last decade of research in neuroscience is that functional and structural brain connectivity matter. Specifically, it has been accepted that the organization of the brain in interacting segregated networks enables its function. In this paper we delineate the route to a promising approach for investigating timing mechanisms. We illustrate how novel insight into timing mechanisms can come by investigating brain functioning as a multi-layer dynamical network whose clustered dynamics is bound to report the presence of metastable states. We anticipate that metastable dynamics underlie the real-time coordination necessary for the brain's dynamic functioning associated to time perception. This new point of view will help further clarifying mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {Considerable effort has gone into understanding the mechanisms underlying high-frequency 'bursting' of thalamocortical impulses, their sensory information content and their involvement in perception. However, little is known about the influence of such impulses on their cortical targets. Here we follow bursting thalamic impulses to their terminus at the thalamocortical synapse of the awake rabbit, and examine their influence on a class of somatosensory cortical neurons. We show that thalamic bursts potently activate cortical circuits. Initial impulses of each burst have a greatly enhanced ability to elicit cortical action potentials, and later impulses in the burst further raise the probability of eliciting spikes. In some cases, multiple cortical spikes result from a single burst. Moreover, we show that the interval preceding each burst is crucial for generating the enhanced cortical response. The powerful activation of neocortex by thalamocortical bursts is fully consistent with an involvement of these impulses in perceptual/attentional processes.},

@article{denve_2017,
abstract = {Understanding how the brain learns to compute functions reliably, efficiently, and robustly with noisy spiking activity is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Most sensory and motor tasks can be described as dynamical systems and could presumably be learned by adjusting connection weights in a recurrent biological neural network. However, this is greatly complicated by the credit assignment problem for learning in recurrent networks, e.g., the contribution of each connection to the global output error cannot be determined based only on locally accessible quantities to the synapse. Combining tools from adaptive control theory and efficient coding theories, we propose that neural circuits can indeed learn complex dynamic tasks with local synaptic plasticity rules as long as they associate two experimentally established neural mechanisms. First, they should receive top-down feedbacks driving both their activity and their synaptic plasticity. Second, inhibitory interneurons should maintain a tight balance between excitation and inhibition in the circuit. The resulting networks could learn arbitrary dynamical systems and produce irregular spike trains as variable as those observed experimentally. Yet, this variability in single neurons may hide an extremely efficient and robust computation at the population level. Copyright $\backslash$copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Theoretical studies have proposed an underlying role of chaos in neural systems. Nevertheless, whether chaotic neural oscillators make a significant contribution to network behaviour and whether the dynamical richness of neural networks is sensitive to the dynamics of isolated neurons, still remain open questions. We investigated synchronization transitions in heterogeneous neural networks of neurons connected by electrical coupling in a small world topology. The nodes in our model are oscillatory neurons that - when isolated - can exhibit either chaotic or non-chaotic behaviour, depending on conductance parameters. We found that the heterogeneity of firing rates and firing patterns make a greater contribution than chaos to the steepness of the synchronization transition curve. We also show that chaotic dynamics of the isolated neurons do not always make a visible difference in the transition to full synchrony. Moreover, macroscopic chaos is observed regardless of the dynamics nature of the neurons. However, performing a Functional Connectivity Dynamics analysis, we show that chaotic nodes can promote what is known as multi-stable behaviour, where the network dynamically switches between a number of different semi-synchronized, metastable states.},

There are many aspects of neuronal interactions and connectivity that engender the complexity of brain dynamics. In this paper we consider (i) the nature of this complexity and (ii) how it depends on connections between neuronal systems (e.g., neuronal populations or cortical areas). The main conclusion is that simulated neural systems show complex behaviors, reminiscent of neuronal dynamics, when these extrinsic connections are sparse. The patterns of activity that obtain, under these conditions, show a rich form of intermittency with the recurrent and self-limiting expression of stereotyped transient-like dynamics. Despite the fact that these dynamics conform to a single (complex) attractor this metastability gives the illusion of a dynamically changing attractor manifold (i.e., a changing surface upon which the dynamics unfold). This metastability is characterized using a measure that is based on the entropy of the time series' spectral density.},

In contrast, conscious processing of unmasked words was characterized by the convergence of four distinct neurophysiological markers: sustained voltage changes, particularly in prefrontal cortex, large increases in spectral power in the gamma band, increases in long-distance phase synchrony in the beta range, and increases in long-range Granger causality. We argue that all of those measures provide distinct windows into the same distributed state of conscious processing.

abstract = {Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) offers a powerful means of forming and modifying neural circuits. Experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated its potential usefulness for functions as varied as cortical map development, sharpening of sensory receptive fields, working memory, and associative learning. Even so, it is unlikely that STDP works alone. Unless changes in synaptic strength are coordinated across multiple synapses and with other neuronal properties, it is difficult to maintain the stability and functionality of neural circuits. Moreover, there are certain features of early postnatal development (e.g., rapid changes in sensory input) that threaten neural circuit stability in ways that STDP may not be well placed to counter. These considerations have led researchers to investigate additional types of plasticity, complementary to STDP, that may serve to constrain synaptic weights and/or neuronal firing. These are collectively known as "homeostatic plasticity" and include schemes that control the total synaptic strength of a neuron, that modulate its intrinsic excitability as a function of average activity, or that make the ability of synapses to undergo Hebbian modification depend upon their history of use. In this article, we will review the experimental evidence for homeostatic forms of plasticity and consider how they might interact with STDP during development, and learning and memory. {\textcopyright} 2010 Watt and Desai.},

abstract = {A free-energy principle has been proposed recently that accounts for action, perception and learning. This Review looks at some key brain theories in the biological (for example, neural Darwinism) and physical (for example, information theory and optimal control theory) sciences from the free-energy perspective. Crucially, one key theme runs through each of these theories - optimization. Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that is optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free-energy framework.},

abstract = {An important issue in neuroscience is the characterization for the underlying architectures of complex brain networks. However, little is known about the network of anatomical connections in the human brain. Here, we investigated large-scale anatomical connection patterns of the human cerebral cortex using cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance images. Two areas were considered anatomically connected if they showed statistically significant correlations in cortical thickness and we constructed the network of such connections using 124 brains from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping database. Significant short- and long-range connections were found in both intra- and interhemispheric regions, many of which were consistent with known neuroanatomical pathways measured by human diffusion imaging. More importantly, we showed that the human brain anatomical network had robust small-world properties with cohesive neighborhoods and short mean distances between regions that were insensitive to the selection of correlation thresholds. Additionally, we also found that this network and the probability of finding a connection between 2 regions for a given anatomical distance had both exponentially truncated power-law distributions. Our results demonstrated the basic organizational principles for the anatomical network in the human brain compatible with previous functional networks studies, which provides important implications of how functional brain states originate from their structural underpinnings. To our knowledge, this study provides the first report of small-world properties and degree distribution of anatomical networks in the human brain using cortical thickness measurements.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the dynamical scenarios of transitions between normal and paroxysmal state in epilepsy. We assume that some epileptic neural network are bistable i.e., they feature two operational states, ictal and interictal that co-exist. The transitions between these two states may occur according to a Poisson process, a random walk process or as a result of deterministic time-dependent mechanisms. We analyze data from animal models of absence epilepsy, human epilepsies and in vitro models. The distributions of durations of ictal and interictal epochs are fitted with a gamma distribution. On the basis of qualitative features of the fits, we identify the dynamical processes that may have generated the underlying data. The analysis showed that the following hold. 1) The dynamics of ictal epochs differ from those of interictal states. 2) Seizure initiation can be accounted for by a random walk process while seizure termination is often mediated by deterministic mechanisms. 3) In certain cases, the transitions between ictal and interictal states can be modeled by a Poisson process operating in a bistable network. These results imply that exact prediction of seizure occurrence is not possible but termination of an ictal state by appropriate counter stimulation might be feasible.},

abstract = {Gamma oscillations are thought to transiently link distributed cell assemblies that are processing related information, a function that is probably important for network processes such as perception, attentional selection and memory. This 'binding' mechanism requires that spatially distributed cells fire together with millisecond range precision; however, it is not clear how such coordinated timing is achieved given that the frequency of gamma oscillations varies substantially across space and time, from approximately 25 to almost 150 Hz. Here we show that gamma oscillations in the {\{}CA1{\}} area of the hippocampus split into distinct fast and slow frequency components that differentially couple {\{}CA1{\}} to inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex, an area that provides information about the animal's current position, and {\{}CA3{\}}, a hippocampal subfield essential for storage of such information. Fast gamma oscillations in {\{}CA1{\}} were synchronized with fast gamma in medial entorhinal cortex, and slow gamma oscillations in {\{}CA1{\}} were coherent with slow gamma in {\{}CA3{\}}. Significant proportions of cells in medial entorhinal cortex and {\{}CA3{\}} were phase-locked to fast and slow {\{}CA1{\}} gamma waves, respectively. The two types of gamma occurred at different phases of the {\{}CA1{\}} theta rhythm and mostly on different theta cycles. These results point to routeing of information as a possible function of gamma frequency variations in the brain and provide a mechanism for temporal segregation of potentially interfering information from different sources.},

abstract = {Chimera states, namely the coexistence of coherent and incoherent behavior, were previously analyzed in complex networks. However, they have not been extensively studied in modular networks. Here, we consider a neural network inspired by the connectome of the C. elegans soil worm, organized into six interconnected communities, where neurons obey chaotic bursting dynamics. Neurons are assumed to be connected with electrical synapses within their communities and with chemical synapses across them. As our numerical simulations reveal, the coaction of these two types of coupling can shape the dynamics in such a way that chimera-like states can happen. They consist of a fraction of synchronized neurons which belong to the larger communities, and a fraction of desynchronized neurons which are part of smaller communities. In addition to the Kuramoto order parameter $\rho$, we also employ other measures of coherence, such as the chimera-like $\xi$ and metastability $\lambda$ indices, which quantify the degree of synchronization among communities and along time, respectively. We perform the same analysis for networks that share common features with the C. elegans neural network. Similar results suggest that under certain assumptions, chimera-like states are prominent phenomena in modular networks, and might provide insight for the behavior of more complex modular networks.},

abstract = {Transient periods of synchronization of oscillating neuronal discharges in the frequency range 30-80 Hz (gamma oscillations) have been proposed to act as an integrative mechanism that may bring a widely distributed set of neurons together into a coherent ensemble that underlies a cognitive act. Results of several experiments in animals provide support for this idea. In humans, gamma oscillations have been described both on the scalp (measured by electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography) and in intracortical recordings, but no direct participation of synchrony in a cognitive task has been demonstrated so far. Here we record electrical brain activity from subjects who are viewing ambiguous visual stimuli (perceived either as faces or as meaningless shapes). We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that only face perception induces a long-distance pattern of synchronization, corresponding to the moment of perception itself and to the ensuing motor response. A period of strong desynchronization marks the transition between the moment of perception and the motor response. We suggest that this desynchronization reflects a process of active uncoupling of the underlying neural ensembles that is necessary to proceed from one cognitive state to another.},

It is well established that the brain's capacity to integrate information from numerous sources forms the basis for cognitive abilities. However, the core unresolved question is how information about the "objective" physical entities of the external world can be integrated, and how unified and coherent mental states (or Gestalts) can be established in the internal entities of distributed neuronal systems. The present paper offers a unified methodological and conceptual basis for a possible mechanism of how the transient synchronization of brain operations may construct the unified and relatively stable neural states, which underlie mental states. It was shown that the sequence of metastable spatial EEG mosaics does exist and probably reflects the rapid stabilization periods of the interrelation of large neuron systems. At the EEG level this is reflected in the stabilization of quasi-stationary segments on corresponding channels. Within the introduced framework, physical brain processes and psychological processes are considered as two basic aspects of a single whole informational brain state. The relations between operational process of the brain, mental states and consciousness are discussed.},

abstract = {Neuronal dynamics unfolding within the cerebral cortex exhibit complex spatial and temporal patterns even in the absence of external input. Here we use a computational approach in an attempt to relate these features of spontaneous cortical dynamics to the underlying anatomical connectivity. Simulating nonlinear neuronal dynamics on a network that captures the large-scale interregional connections of macaque neocortex, and applying information theoretic measures to identify functional networks, we find structure-function relations at multiple temporal scales. Functional networks recovered from long windows of neural activity (minutes) largely overlap with the underlying structural network. As a result, hubs in these long-run functional networks correspond to structural hubs. In contrast, significant fluctuations in functional topology are observed across the sequence of networks recovered from consecutive shorter (seconds) time windows. The functional centrality of individual nodes varies across time as interregional couplings shift. Furthermore, the transient couplings between brain regions are coordinated in a manner that reveals the existence of two anticorrelated clusters. These clusters are linked by prefrontal and parietal regions that are hub nodes in the underlying structural network. At an even faster time scale (hundreds of milliseconds) we detect individual episodes of interregional phase-locking and find that slow variations in the statistics of these transient episodes, contingent on the underlying anatomical structure, produce the transfer entropy functional connectivity and simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent correlation patterns observed on slower time scales. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Recent studies show that the neocortex is not only organized in columns and layers but also, within these, into synaptically connected clusters of neurons1,2. The recently discovered common neighbor rule, according to which the probability of any two neurons being synaptically connected grows with the number of their common neighbors, is an organizing principle for this local clustering. Here we investigated the theoretical constraints for how the spatial extent of neuronal axonal and dendritic arborization, heretofore described by morphological reach, the density of neurons and the size of the network determine cluster size and numbers within neural networks constructed according to the common neighbor rule. In the formulation we developed, morphological reach, cell density and network size are sufficient to estimate how many neurons, on average, occur in a cluster and how many clusters exist in a given network. We find that cluster sizes do not grow indefinitely as network parameters increase, but tend to characteristic limiting values. {\textcopyright} 2013 Perin, Telefont and Markram.},

abstract = {My purpose in this paper is to sketch a research direction based on Francisco Varela's pioneering work in neurodynamics (see also Rudrauf et al. 2003, in this issue). Very early on he argued that the internal coherence of every mental-cognitive state lies in the global self-organization of the brain activities at the large-scale, constituting a fundamental pole of integration called here a "dynamic core". Recent neuroimaging evidence appears to broadly support this hypothesis and suggests that a global brain dynamics emerges at the large scale level from the cooperative interactions among widely distributed neuronal populations. Despite a growing body of evidence supporting this view, our understanding of these large-scale brain processes remains hampered by the lack of a theoretical language for expressing these complex behaviors in dynamical terms. In this paper, I propose a rough cartography of a comprehensive approach that offers a conceptual and mathematical framework to analyze spatio-temporal large-scale brain phenomena. I emphasize how these nonlinear methods can be applied, what property might be inferred from neuronal signals, and where one might productively proceed for the future. This paper is dedicated, with respect and affection, to the memory of Francisco Varela.},
