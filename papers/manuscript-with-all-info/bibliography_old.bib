abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and {fMRI} experiments. Finally, the authors consider the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain systems.}

abstract = {Neurons carry out the many operations that extract meaningful information from sensory receptor arrays at the organism's periphery and translate these into action, imagery and memory. Within today's dominant computational paradigm, these operations, involving synapses, membrane ionic channels and changes in membrane potential, are thought of as steps in an algorithm or as computations. The role of neurons in these computations has evolved conceptually from that of a simple integrator of synaptic inputs until a threshold is reached and an output pulse is initiated, to a much more sophisticated processor with mixed analog-digital logic and highly adaptive synaptic elements.}

abstract = {Attention can be focused volitionally by "top-down" signals derived from task demands and automatically by "bottom-up" signals from salient stimuli. The frontal and parietal cortices are involved, but their neural activity has not been directly compared. Therefore, we recorded from them simultaneously in monkeys. Prefrontal neurons reflected the target location first during top-down attention, whereas parietal neurons signaled it earlier during bottom-up attention. Synchrony between frontal and parietal areas was stronger in lower frequencies during top-down attention and in higher frequencies during bottom-up attention. This result indicates that top-down and bottom-up signals arise from the frontal and sensory cortex, respectively, and different modes of attention may emphasize synchrony at different frequencies.}

To study the underlying mechanisms, we recorded neurons in cortical area V4 while macaque monkeys attended to behaviorally relevant stimuli and ignored distracters. Neurons activated by the attended stimulus showed increased gamma-frequency (35 to 90 hertz) synchronization but reduced low-frequency (\textless 17 hertz) synchronization compared with neurons at nearby V4 sites activated by distracters. Because postsynaptic integration times are short, these localized changes in synchronization may serve to amplify behaviorally relevant signals in the cortex.}

Here, we analyze recovery from pharmacologically induced coma to show that neuronal activity en route to consciousness is confined to a low-dimensional subspace. In this subspace, neuronal activity forms discrete metastable states persistent on the scale of minutes. The network of transitions that links these metastable states is structured such that some states form hubs that connect groups of otherwise disconnected states. Although many paths through the network are possible, to ultimately enter the activity state compatible with consciousness, the brain must first pass through these hubs in an orderly fashion. This organization of metastable states, along with dramatic dimensionality reduction, significantly simplifies the task of sampling the parameter space to recover the state consistent with wakefulness on a physiologically relevant timescale.}

Microelectrode recordings have characterized the activation of single neurons and {fMRI} has unveiled brain-wide activation patterns. Now it is time to understand how the many active neuronal groups interact with each other and how their communication is flexibly modulated to bring about our cognitive dynamics. I hypothesize that neuronal communication is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively, because their communication windows for input and for output are open at the same times. Thus, a flexible pattern of coherence defines a flexible communication structure, which subserves our cognitive flexibility.}

Those interactions are governed by the pattern of anatomical connections and by yet unknown mechanisms that modulate the effective strength of a given connection. We found that the mutual influence among neuronal groups depends on the phase relation between rhythmic activities within the groups. Phase relations supporting interactions between the groups preceded those interactions by a few milliseconds, consistent with a mechanistic role. These effects were specific in time, frequency, and space, and we therefore propose that the pattern of synchronization flexibly determines the pattern of neuronal interactions.}

abstract = {Activated neuronal groups typically engage in rhythmic synchronization in the gamma-frequency range (30-100 Hz). Experimental and modeling studies demonstrate that each gamma cycle is framed by synchronized spiking of inhibitory interneurons. Here, we review evidence suggesting that the resulting rhythmic network inhibition interacts with excitatory input to pyramidal cells such that the more excited cells fire earlier in the gamma cycle. Thus, the amplitude of excitatory drive is recoded into phase values of discharges relative to the gamma cycle. This recoding enables transmission and read out of amplitude information within a single gamma cycle without requiring rate integration. Furthermore, variation of phase relations can be exploited to facilitate or inhibit exchange of information between oscillating cell assemblies. The gamma cycle could thus serve as a fundamental computational mechanism for the implementation of a temporal coding scheme that enables fast processing and flexible routing of activity, supporting fast selection and binding of distributed responses.

abstract = {Classical theories of sensory processing view the brain as a passive, stimulus-driven device. By contrast, more recent approaches emphasize the constructive nature of perception, viewing it as an active and highly selective process. Indeed, there is ample evidence that the processing of stimuli is controlled by top-down influences that strongly shape the intrinsic dynamics of thalamocortical networks and constantly create predictions about forthcoming sensory events. We discuss recent experiments indicating that such predictions might be embodied in the temporal structure of both stimulus-evoked and ongoing activity, and that synchronous oscillations are particularly important in this process. Coherence among subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations could be exploited to express selective functional relationships during states of expectancy or attention, and these dynamic patterns could allow the grouping and selection of distributed neuronal responses for further processing.}

abstract = {Gamma oscillations are thought to transiently link distributed cell assemblies that are processing related information, a function that is probably important for network processes such as perception, attentional selection and memory. This 'binding' mechanism requires that spatially distributed cells fire together with millisecond range precision; however, it is not clear how such coordinated timing is achieved given that the frequency of gamma oscillations varies substantially across space and time, from approximately 25 to almost 150 Hz. Here we show that gamma oscillations in the {CA1} area of the hippocampus split into distinct fast and slow frequency components that differentially couple {CA1} to inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex, an area that provides information about the animal's current position, and {CA3}, a hippocampal subfield essential for storage of such information. Fast gamma oscillations in {CA1} were synchronized with fast gamma in medial entorhinal cortex, and slow gamma oscillations in {CA1} were coherent with slow gamma in {CA3}. Significant proportions of cells in medial entorhinal cortex and {CA3} were phase-locked to fast and slow {CA1} gamma waves, respectively. The two types of gamma occurred at different phases of the {CA1} theta rhythm and mostly on different theta cycles. These results point to routeing of information as a possible function of gamma frequency variations in the brain and provide a mechanism for temporal segregation of potentially interfering information from different sources.}

Phase synchronization - here referring to the synchronization of oscillatory phases between different brain regions - supports both working memory and long-term memory and acts by facilitating neural communication and by promoting neural plasticity. There is evidence that processes underlying working and long-term memory might interact in the medial temporal lobe. We propose that this is accomplished by neural operations involving phase-phase and phase-amplitude synchronization. A deeper understanding of how phase synchronization supports the flexibility of and interaction between memory systems may yield new insights into the functions of phase synchronization in general.}

abstract = {Cognitive functions like perception, memory, language, or consciousness are based on highly parallel and distributed information processing by the brain. One of the major unresolved questions is how information can be integrated and how coherent representational states can be established in the distributed neuronal systems subserving these functions. It has been suggested that this so-called "binding problem" may be solved in the temporal domain. The hypothesis is that synchronization of neuronal discharges can serve for the integration of distributed neurons into cell assemblies and that this process may underlie the selection of perceptually and behaviorally relevant information. As we intend to show here, this temporal binding hypothesis has implications for the search of the neural correlate of consciousness. We review experimental results, mainly obtained in the visual system, which support the notion of temporal binding. In particular, we discuss recent experiments on the neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry which suggest that appropriate synchronization among cortical neurons may be one of the necessary conditions for the buildup of perceptual states and awareness of sensory stimuli.

The signals between neurons and glia include ion fluxes, neurotransmitters, cell adhesion molecules, and specialized signaling molecules released from synaptic and nonsynaptic regions of the neuron. In contrast to the serial flow of information along chains of neurons, glia communicate with other glial cells through intracellular waves of calcium and via intercellular diffusion of chemical messengers. By releasing neurotransmitters and other extracellular signaling molecules, glia can affect neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission and perhaps coordinate activity across networks of neurons.}

Recent advances in our understanding of cortical microcircuitry suggest that the timing of neuronal spikes conveys little, if any, information. The cortex is likely to propagate a noisy rate code through redundant, patchy interconnections.}

Nonconscious processing of masked words was observed in multiple cortical areas, mostly within an early time window (\textless 300 ms), accompanied by induced gamma-band activity, but without coherent long-distance neural activity, suggesting a quickly dissipating feedforward wave. In contrast, conscious processing of unmasked words was characterized by the convergence of four distinct neurophysiological markers: sustained voltage changes, particularly in prefrontal cortex, large increases in spectral power in the gamma band, increases in long-distance phase synchrony in the beta range, and increases in long-range Granger causality. We argue that all of those measures provide distinct windows into the same distributed state of conscious processing. These results have a direct impact on current theoretical discussions concerning the neural correlates of conscious access.}

Four main classes of neurons could be clearly distinguished: regular spiking ({RS}), fast spiking ({FS}), intrinsic bursting ({IB}), and chattering ({CH}). Each of these contained significant subclasses. {RS} neurons were characterized by trains of action potentials that exhibited spike frequency adaptation. Morphologically, these cells were spiny stellate cells in layer 4 and pyramidal cells in layers 2, 3, 5, and 6. {FS} neurons had short-duration action potentials (\textless 0.5 ms at half height), little or no spike frequency adaptation, and a steep relationship between injected current intensity and spike discharge frequency. Morphologically, these cells were sparsely spiny or aspiny nonpyramidal cells. {IB} neurons typically generated a low frequency (\textless 425 Hz) burst of spikes at the beginning of a depolarizing current pulse followed by a tonic train of action potentials for the remainder of the pulse. These cells were observed in all cortical layers, but were most abundant in layer 5. Finally, {CH} neurons generated repetitive, high-frequency (350-700 Hz) bursts of short-duration (\textless 0.55 ms) action potentials. Morphologically, these cells were layer 2-4 (mainly layer 3) pyramidal or spiny stellate neurons. These results indicate that firing properties do not form a continuum and that cortical neurons are members of distinct electrophysiological classes and subclasses.}

A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.}

abstract = {Attention selectively enhances the influence of neuronal responses conveying information about relevant sensory attributes. Accumulating evidence suggests that this selective neuronal modulation relies on rhythmic synchronization at local and long-range spatial scales: attention selectively synchronizes the rhythmic responses of those neurons that are tuned to the spatial and featural attributes of the attended sensory input. The strength of synchronization is thereby functionally related to perceptual accuracy and behavioural efficiency. Complementing this synchronization at a local level, attention has recently been demonstrated to regulate which locally synchronized neuronal groups phase-synchronize their rhythmic activity across long-range connections. These results point to a general computational role for selective synchronization in dynamically controlling which neurons communicate information about sensory inputs effectively.}

abstract = {1. The physiological and functional features of time-dependent anomalous rectification activated by hyperpolarization and the current which underlies it, Ih, were examined in guinea-pig and cat thalamocortical relay neurones using in vitro intracellular recording techniques in thalamic slices. 2. Hyperpolarization of the membrane from rest with a constant-current pulse resulted in time-dependent rectification, expressed as a depolarizing sag of the membrane potential back towards rest. Under voltage clamp conditions, hyperpolarizing steps to membrane potentials negative to approximately -60 {mV} were associated with the activation of a slow inward current, Ih, which showed no inactivation with time. 3. The activation curve of the conductance underlying Ih was obtained through analysis of tail currents and ranged from -60 to -90 {mV}, with half-activation occurring at -75 {mV}. The time course of activation of Ih was well fitted by a single-exponential function and was strongly voltage dependent, with time constants ranging from greater than 1-2 s at threshold to an average of 229 ms at -95 {mV}. The time course of de-activation was also described by a single-exponential function, was voltage dependent, and the time constant ranged from an average of 1000 ms at -80 {mV} to 347 ms at -55 {mV}. 4. Raising [K+]o from 2.5 to 7.5 {mM} enhanced, while decreasing [Na+]o from 153 to 26 {mM} reduced, the amplitude of Ih. In addition, reduction of [Na+]o slowed the rate of Ih activation. These results indicate that Ih is carried by both Na+ and K+ ions, which is consistent with the extrapolated reversal potential of -43 {mV}. Replacement of Cl- in the bathing medium with isethionate shifted the chloride equilibrium potential positive by approximately 30-70 {mV}, evoked an inward shift of the holding current at -50 {mV}, and resulted in a marked reduction of instantaneous currents as well as Ih, suggesting a non-specific blocking action of impermeable anions. 5. Local (2-10 {mM} in micropipette) or bath (1-2 {mM}) applications of Cs+ abolished Ih over the whole voltage range tested (-60 to -110 {mV}), with no consistent effects on instantaneous currents. Barium (1 {mM}, local; 0.3-0.5 {mM}, bath) evoked a steady inward current, reduced the amplitude of instantaneous currents, and had only weak suppressive effects on Ih. 6. Block of Ih with local application of Cs+ resulted in a hyperpolarization of the membrane from the resting level, a decrease in apparent membrane conductance, and a block of the slow after-hyperpolarization that appears upon termination of depolarizing membrane responses, indicating that Ih contributes substantially to the resting and active membrane properties of thalamocortical relay neurones.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})}

Many studies have examined the effect of a stimulus on the mean response, but few have examined the effect on response variability. We measured neural variability in 13 extracellularly recorded datasets and one intracellularly recorded dataset from seven areas spanning the four cortical lobes in monkeys and cats. In every case, stimulus onset caused a decline in neural variability. This occurred even when the stimulus produced little change in mean firing rate. The variability decline was observed in membrane potential recordings, in the spiking of individual neurons and in correlated spiking variability measured with implanted 96-electrode arrays. The variability decline was observed for all stimuli tested, regardless of whether the animal was awake, behaving or anaesthetized. This widespread variability decline suggests a rather general property of cortex, that its state is stabilized by an input.}

abstract = {The high variability of cortical sensory responses is often assumed to impose a major constraint on efficient computation. In the auditory cortex, however, response variability can be very low. We have used in vivo whole cell patch-clamp methods to study the trial-to-trial variability of the subthreshold fluctuations in membrane potential underlying tone-evoked responses in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats. Using methods adapted from classical quantal analysis, we partitioned this subthreshold variability into a private component (which includes synaptic, thermal, and other sources local to the recorded cell) and a shared component arising from network interactions. Here we report that this private component is remarkably small, usually about 1-3 {mV}, as quantified by the variance divided by the mean of the ensemble of tone-evoked response heights. The shared component can be much larger, and shows more heterogeneity across the population, ranging from about 0 to 10 {mV}. The remarkable fact that, at least 5 synapses from the auditory periphery, this variability remains so small raises the possibility that the intervening neural circuitry is organized so as to prevent private noise from accumulating as neural signals propagate to the cortex.}

In the chronnectome, coupling refers to possibly time-varying levels of correlated or mutually informed activity between brain regions whose spatial properties may also be temporally evolving. We primarily focus on multivariate approaches developed in our group and review a number of approaches with an emphasis on matrix decompositions such as principle component analysis and independent component analysis. We also discuss the potential these approaches offer to improve characterization and understanding of brain function. There are a number of methodological directions that need to be developed further, but chronnectome approaches already show great promise for the study of both the healthy and the diseased brain.}

We provide a calibration of both estimators using the theory of renewal processes, and verify it for spike trains recorded in vitro. Both estimators exhibit a considerable bias for short observations that count less than about 5-10 spikes on average. The practical difficulty of measuring the {CV}(2) in rate modulated data can be overcome by a simple procedure of spike train demodulation which was tested in numerical simulations and in real spike trains. We propose to test neuronal spike trains for deviations from the null-hypothesis {FF}={CV}(2). We show that cortical pyramidal neurons, recorded under controlled stationary input conditions in vitro, comply with this assumption. Performing a time-resolved joint analysis of {CV}(2) and {FF} of a single unit recording from the motor cortex of a behaving monkey we demonstrate how the dynamic change of their quantitative relation can be interpreted with respect to neuron intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence cortical variability in vivo. Finally, we discuss the effect of several additional factors such as serial interval correlation and refractory period on the empiric relation of {FF} and {CV}(2).}

abstract = {Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a "high-input regime" in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50-100 neurons. These column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10-50 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons-that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.}

Spike count variability was lower than that of a Poisson process at all three stages but increased at each stage. Absolute and relative refractory periods largely accounted for the reliability at all three stages. Our results show that cortical responses can be more reliable than previously thought. The differences in reliability in retina, {LGN}, and cortex can be explained by (1) decreasing firing rates and (2) decreasing absolute and relative refractory periods.}

We examined recordings from primary visual cortex (V1; Knierim and Van Essen, 1992) and extrastriate cortex ({MT}; Newsome et al., 1989a) of awake, behaving macaque monkey and compared them to analytical predictions. For nonbursting cells firing at sustained rates up to 300 Hz, we evaluated two indices of firing variability: the ratio of the variance to the mean for the number of action potentials evoked by a constant stimulus, and the rate-normalized coefficient of variation (Cv) of the interspike interval distribution. Firing in virtually all V1 and {MT} neurons was nearly consistent with a completely random process (e.g., Cv approximately 1). We tried to model this high variability by small, independent, and random {EPSPs} converging onto a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron (Knight, 1972). Both this and related models predicted very low firing variability (Cv \textless 1) for realistic {EPSP} depolarizations and membrane time constants. We also simulated a biophysically very detailed compartmental model of an anatomically reconstructed and physiologically characterized layer V cat pyramidal cell (Douglas et al., 1991) with passive dendrites and active soma. If independent, excitatory synaptic input fired the model cell at the high rates observed in monkey, the Cv and the variability in the number of spikes were both very low, in agreement with the integrate-and-fire models but in strong disagreement with the majority of our monkey data. The simulated cell only produced highly variable firing when Hodgkin-Huxley-like currents ({INa} and very strong {IDR}) were placed on distal dendrites. Now the simulated neuron acted more as a millisecond-resolution detector of dendritic spike coincidences than as a temporal integrator. We argue that neurons that act as temporal integrators over many synaptic inputs must fire very regularly. Only in the presence of either fast and strong dendritic nonlinearities or strong synchronization among individual synaptic events will the degree of predicted variability approach that of real cortical neurons.}

abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex invariably involves the activation of millions of neurons that are widely distributed over its various areas. These distributed activity patterns need to be integrated into coherent representational states. A candidate mechanism for the integration and coordination of neuronal activity between different brain regions is synchronization on a fine temporal scale. In the visual cortex, synchronization occurs selectively between the responses of neurons that represent related features and that need to be integrated for the generation of coherent percepts; neurons in other areas of the cerebral cortex also synchronize their discharges. However, little is known about the patterns and the behavioural correlates of synchrony among widely separated cortical regions. Here we report that synchronization occurs between areas of the visual and parietal cortex, and between areas of the parietal and motor cortex, in the awake cat. When cats responded to a sudden change of a visual pattern, neuronal activity in cortical areas exhibited synchrony without time lags; this synchrony was particularly strong between areas subserving related functions. During reward and inter-trial episodes, zero-time-lag synchrony was lost and replaced by interactions exhibiting large and unsystematic time lags.}

The motivation for its development is to be able to examine the role of neural synchronies as a putative mechanism for long-range neural integration during cognitive tasks. The method, called phase-locking statistics ({PLS}), measures the significance of the phase covariance between two signals with a reasonable time-resolution (\textless 100 ms). Unlike the more traditional method of spectral coherence, {PLS} separates the phase and amplitude components and can be directly interpreted in the framework of neural integration. To validate synchrony values against background fluctuations, {PLS} uses surrogate data and thus makes no a priori assumptions on the nature of the experimental data. We also apply {PLS} to investigate intracortical recordings from an epileptic patient performing a visual discrimination task. We find large-scale synchronies in the gamma band (45 Hz), e.g., between hippocampus and frontal gyrus, and local synchronies, within a limbic region, a few cm apart. We argue that whereas long-scale effects do reflect cognitive processing, short-scale synchronies are likely to be due to volume conduction. We discuss ways to separate such conduction effects from true signal synchrony.}

The lateral geniculate nucleus, which is the thalamic relay of retinal information to cortex, provides a reasonable model for all of thalamus. Compared with burst mode, geniculate relay cells that are firing in tonic mode exhibit better linear summation, but have poorer detectability for visual stimuli. The switch between the response modes can be controlled by nonretinal, modulatory afferents to these cells, such as the feedback pathway from cortex. This allows the thalamus to provide a dynamic relay that affects the nature and format of information that reaches the cortex.}

abstract = {Sensory, motor and cortical neurons fire impulses or spikes at a regular, but slowly declining, rate in response to a constant current stimulus. Yet, the intervals between spikes often vary randomly during behaviour. Is this variation an unavoidable effect of generating spikes by sensory or synaptic processes ('neural noise') or is it an important part of the 'signal' that is transmitted to other neurons? Here, we mainly discuss this question in relation to sensory and motor processes, as the signals are best identified in such systems, although we also touch on central processes.}

M. and {McCormick} D. A. (1996) Science 274, 109-113]. The bursting mechanism involves a "ping-pong" interplay between soma-to-dendrite back propagation of action potentials and an afterdepolarization generated by a persistent dendritic Na+ current and a somatic Na+ window current. The oscillation period is primarily determined by a slowly inactivating K+ channel and passive membrane properties. The model behavior is compared quantitatively with the experimental data. It is shown that the cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation can transform the model cell's firing pattern from tonic spiking to rapid bursting, as a possible pathway for acetylcholine to promote 40-Hz oscillations in the visual cortex. To explore possible functions of fast burst firing in the neocortex, a hypothetical neural pair is simulated, where a chattering cell is presynaptic to an inhibitory interneuron via stochastic synapses. For this purpose, we use a synapse model endowed with a low release probability, short-term facilitation and vesicle depletion. This synapse model reproduces the behavior of certain neocortical pyramid-to-interneuron synapses [Thomson A. M. et al. (1993) Neuroscience 54, 347-360]. We showed that the burstiness of cell firing is required for the rhythmicity to be reliably transmitted to the postsynaptic cell via unreliable synapses, and that fast burst firing of chattering neurons can provide an exceptionally powerful drive for recruiting feedback inhibition in cortical circuits. From these results, we propose that the fast rhythmic burst firing of neocortical chattering neurons is generated by a calcium-independent ionic mechanism. Our simulation results on the neural pair highlight the importance of characterizing the short-term plasticity of the synaptic connections made by chattering cells, in order to understand their putative pacemaker role in synchronized gamma oscillations of the visual cortex.}

We attempt to characterize a wide variety of cortical connectivity data sets using a specific set of graph theory methods. We measure global aspects of cortical graphs including the abundance of small structural motifs such as cycles, the degree of local clustering of connections and the average path length. We examine large-scale cortical connection matrices obtained from neuroanatomical data bases, as well as probabilistic connection matrices at the level of small cortical neuronal populations linked by intra-areal and inter-areal connections. All cortical connection matrices examined in this study exhibit "small-world" attributes, characterized by the presence of abundant clustering of connections combined with short average distances between neuronal elements. We discuss the significance of these universal organizational features of cortex in light of functional brain anatomy. Supplementary materials are at www.indiana.edu/\~cortex/lab.htm.}

One of the most important transitions in neuronal response patterns is the transition from tonic firing to burst discharges, i.e., when the neuronal activity changes from single spikes to the grouping of spikes. An increased number of interspike-interval sequences of specific temporal correlations was detected in anticipation of temperature induced tonic-to-bursting transitions in both, experimental impulse recordings from hypothalamic brain slices and numerical simulations of a stochastic model. Analysis of the modelling data elucidates that the appearance of such patterns can be related to particular system dynamics in the vicinity of the period-doubling bifurcation. It leads to a nonlinear response on de- and hyperpolarizing perturbations introduced by noise. This explains why such particular patterns can be found as reliable precursors of the neurons' transition to burst discharges.}

We observe asynchronous and various synchronous states such as out-of-phase, in-phase and almost in-phase chaotic synchronization. The highest variety of synchronous states occurs at the transition from tonic firing to chaos where the highest coupling strength is also needed for in-phase synchronization which is, essentially, facilitated towards the bursting range. This demonstrates that tuning of the neuron's internal dynamics can have significant impact on the synchronous states especially at the physiologically relevant tonic-to-bursting transitions.}

abstract = {An in vivo preparation has been developed to study the mechanisms underlying spontaneous sleep oscillations. Dual and triple simultaneous intracellular recordings were made from neurons in small isolated cortical slabs (10 mm x 6 mm) in anesthetized cats. Spontaneously occurring slow sleep oscillations, present in the adjacent intact cortex, were absent in small slabs. However, the isolated slabs displayed brief active periods separated by long periods of silence, up to 60 s in duration. During these silent periods, 60\% of neurons showed non-linear amplification of low-amplitude depolarizing activity. Nearly 40\% of the cells, twice as many as in intact cortex, were classified as intrinsically bursting. In cortical network models based on Hodgkin-Huxley-like neurons, the summation of simulated spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials was sufficient to activate a persistent sodium current, initiating action potentials in single neurons that then spread through the network. Consistent with this model, enlarging the isolated cortical territory to an isolated gyrus (30 mm x 20 mm) increased the probability of initiating large-scale activity. In these larger territories, both the frequency and regularity of the slow oscillation approached that generated in intact cortex. The frequency of active periods in an analytical model of the cortical network accurately predicted the scaling observed in simulations and from recordings in cortical slabs of increasing size.}

abstract = {Subliminal stimuli can be deeply processed and activate similar brain areas as consciously perceived stimuli. This raises the question which signatures of neural activity critically differentiate conscious from unconscious processing. Transient synchronization of neural activity has been proposed as a neural correlate of conscious perception. Here we test this proposal by comparing the electrophysiological responses related to the processing of visible and invisible words in a delayed matching to sample task. Both perceived and nonperceived words caused a similar increase of local (gamma) oscillations in the {EEG}, but only perceived words induced a transient long-distance synchronization of gamma oscillations across widely separated regions of the brain. After this transient period of temporal coordination, the electrographic signatures of conscious and unconscious processes continue to diverge. Only words reported as perceived induced (1) enhanced theta oscillations over frontal regions during the maintenance interval, (2) an increase of the P300 component of the event-related potential, and (3) an increase in power and phase synchrony of gamma oscillations before the anticipated presentation of the test word. We propose that the critical process mediating the access to conscious perception is the early transient global increase of phase synchrony of oscillatory activity in the gamma frequency range.}

Population synchrony was strongest during sharp wave ({SPW}) bursts. However, the increase was three times larger for pyramidal cells than for interneurons. The contribution of single pyramidal cells to the discharge of interneurons was often large (up to 0.6 probability), as assessed by the presence of significant (\textless 3 ms) peaks in the cross-correlogram. Complex-spike bursts were more effective than single spikes. Single cell contribution was higher between {SPW} bursts than during {SPWs} or theta activity.

Results of several experiments in animals provide support for this idea. In humans, gamma oscillations have been described both on the scalp (measured by electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography) and in intracortical recordings, but no direct participation of synchrony in a cognitive task has been demonstrated so far. Here we record electrical brain activity from subjects who are viewing ambiguous visual stimuli (perceived either as faces or as meaningless shapes). We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that only face perception induces a long-distance pattern of synchronization, corresponding to the moment of perception itself and to the ensuing motor response. A period of strong desynchronization marks the transition between the moment of perception and the motor response. We suggest that this desynchronization reflects a process of active uncoupling of the underlying neural ensembles that is necessary to proceed from one cognitive state to another.}

abstract = {Timing and dynamics of information in the brain is a hot field in modern neuroscience. The analysis of the temporal evolution of brain information is crucially important for the understanding of higher cognitive mechanisms in normal and pathological states. From the perspective of information dynamics, in this review we discuss working memory capacity, language dynamics, goal-dependent behavior programming and other functions of brain activity. In contrast with the classical description of information theory, which is mostly algebraic, brain flow information dynamics deals with problems such as the stability/instability of information flows, their quality, the timing of sequential processing, the top-down cognitive control of perceptual information, and information creation. In this framework, different types of information flow instabilities correspond to different cognitive disorders. On the other hand, the robustness of cognitive activity is related to the control of the information flow stability. We discuss these problems using both experimental and theoretical approaches, and we argue that brain activity is better understood considering information flows in the phase space of the corresponding dynamical model. In particular, we show how theory helps to understand intriguing experimental results in this matter, and how recent knowledge inspires new theoretical formalisms that can be tested with modern experimental techniques.

Even for Caenorhabditis elegans, whose neuronal network is relatively small and stereotypical from animal to animal, published wiring diagrams are neither accurate nor complete and self-consistent. Using materials from White et al. and new electron micrographs we assemble whole, self-consistent gap junction and chemical synapse networks of hermaphrodite C. elegans. We propose a method to visualize the wiring diagram, which reflects network signal flow. We calculate statistical and topological properties of the network, such as degree distributions, synaptic multiplicities, and small-world properties, that help in understanding network signal propagation. We identify neurons that may play central roles in information processing, and network motifs that could serve as functional modules of the network. We explore propagation of neuronal activity in response to sensory or artificial stimulation using linear systems theory and find several activity patterns that could serve as substrates of previously described behaviors. Finally, we analyze the interaction between the gap junction and the chemical synapse networks. Since several statistical properties of the C. elegans network, such as multiplicity and motif distributions are similar to those found in mammalian neocortex, they likely point to general principles of neuronal networks. The wiring diagram reported here can help in understanding the mechanistic basis of behavior by generating predictions about future experiments involving genetic perturbations, laser ablations, or monitoring propagation of neuronal activity in response to stimulation.}

Recent work shows that many central synapses are surprisingly unreliable at signaling the arrival of single presynaptic action potentials to the postsynaptic neuron. However, bursts are reliably signaled because transmitter release is facilitated. Thus, these synapses can be viewed as filters that transmit bursts, but filter out single spikes. Bursts appear to have a special role in synaptic plasticity and information processing. In the hippocampus, a single burst can produce long-term synaptic modifications. In brain structures whose computational role is known, action potentials that arrive in bursts provide more-precise information than action potentials that arrive singly. These results, and the requirement for multiple inputs to fire a cell suggest that the best stimulus for exciting a cell (that is, a neural code) is coincident bursts.}

abstract = {Encoding of visual information by {LGN} bursts. Thalamic relay cells respond to visual stimuli either in burst mode, as a result of activation of a low-threshold Ca2+ conductance, or in tonic mode, when this conductance is inactive. We investigated the role of these two response modes for the encoding of the time course of dynamic visual stimuli, based on extracellular recordings of 35 relay cells from the lateral geniculate nucleus of anesthetized cats. We presented a spatially optimized visual stimulus whose contrast fluctuated randomly in time with frequencies of up to 32 Hz. We estimated the visual information in the neural responses using a linear stimulus reconstruction method. Both burst and tonic spikes carried information about stimulus contrast, exceeding one bit per action potential for the highest variance stimuli. The "meaning" of an action potential, i.e., the optimal estimate of the stimulus at times preceding a spike, was similar for burst and tonic spikes. In within-trial comparisons, tonic spikes carried about twice as much information per action potential as bursts, but bursts as unitary events encoded about three times more information per event than tonic spikes. The coding efficiency of a neuron for a particular stimulus is defined as the fraction of the neural coding capacity that carries stimulus information. Based on a lower bound estimate of coding efficiency, bursts had approximately 1.5-fold higher efficiency than tonic spikes, or 3-fold if bursts were considered unitary events. Our main conclusion is that both bursts and tonic spikes encode stimulus information efficiently, which rules out the hypothesis that bursts are nonvisual responses.}

In general, the variance of a neuron's firing rate is directly proportional to its mean firing rate. The probability that a neuron will fire a criterion number of impulses on a stimulus trial grows monotonically with the contrast of a sinusoidal grating stimulus. Neural probability functions prepared either by computing the probability of criterion response or by integrating receiver operating characteristics to yield the probability of correct choice in a two-alternative forced-choice situation resemble psychometric functions obtained in psychophysical and behavioral experiments on humans and animals, but are shallower in slope. The slopes of neuronal probability functions are slightly higher when they are estimated over short time periods, but even so do not equal the slopes measured psychophysically in human and monkey observers. This discrepancy in slope could be explained if the whole observer responded only when about four neurons were active together.}

abstract = {The number of different cortical structures in mammalian brains and the number of extrinsic fibres linking these regions are both large. As with any complex system, systematic analysis is required to draw reliable conclusions about the organization of the complex neural networks comprising these numerous elements. One aspect of organization that has long been suspected is that cortical networks are organized into 'streams' or 'systems'. Here we report computational analyses capable of showing whether clusters of strongly interconnected areas are aspects of the global organization of cortical systems in macaque and cat. We used two different approaches to analyse compilations of corticocortical connection data from the macaque and the cat. The first approach, optimal set analysis, employed an explicit definition of a neural 'system' or 'stream', which was based on differential connectivity. We defined a two-component cost function that described the cost of the global cluster arrangement of areas in terms of the areas' connectivity within and between candidate clusters. Optimal cluster arrangements of cortical areas were then selected computationally from the very many possible arrangements, using an evolutionary optimization algorithm. The second approach, non-parametric cluster analysis ({NPCA}), grouped cortical areas on the basis of their proximity in multidimensional scaling representations. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling to represent the cortical connectivity structures metrically in two and five dimensions. {NPCA} then analysed these representations to determine the nature of the clusters for a wide range of different cluster shape parameters. The results from both approaches largely agreed. They showed that macaque and cat cortices are organized into densely intra-connected clusters of areas, and identified the constituent members of the clusters. These clusters reflected functionally specialized sets of cortical areas, suggesting that structure and function are closely linked at this gross, systems level.}

To test whether, as has been suggested, this high in vivo variability could be due to the postsynaptic currents generated by independent synaptic inputs, we injected synthetic synaptic current into neocortical neurons in brain slices. We report that independent inputs cannot account for this high variability, but this variability can be explained by a simple alternative model of the synaptic drive in which inputs arrive synchronously. Our results suggest that synchrony may be important in the neural code by providing a means for encoding signals with high temporal fidelity over a population of neurons.}

Experimental findings imply that most of the brain's computations can be performed in a non-conscious mode, but that conscious perception is characterized by an amplification, global propagation and integration of brain signals. A comparison of these data with major theoretical proposals suggests that firstly, conscious access must be carefully distinguished from selective attention; secondly, conscious perception may be likened to a non-linear decision that 'ignites' a network of distributed areas; thirdly, information which is selected for conscious perception gains access to additional computations, including temporary maintenance, global sharing, and flexible routing; and finally, measures of the complexity, long-distance correlation and integration of brain signals provide reliable indices of conscious processing, clinically relevant to patients recovering from coma.

The first of these is the von Mises distribution, for which the sample {PLV} is a maximum likelihood estimator. The second is the relative phase distribution associated with bivariate circularly symmetric complex Gaussian data. We derive an explicit expression for the {PLV} for this distribution and show that it is a function of the cross-correlation between the two signals. We compare the bias and variance of the sample {PLV} and the {PLV} computed from the cross-correlation. We also show that both the von Mises and Gaussian models are suitable for representing relative phase in application to {LFP} data from a visually-cued motor study in macaque.

This result suggests that connections in a network can be shaped through synchronization. Here, we test and expand this hypothesis using a model network. We use transfer entropy, an information theoretical measure, to quantify the exchanged information. We show that transferred information depends on the phase relation of the signal, that the amount of exchanged information increases as a function of oscillations in the signal and that the speed of the information transfer increases as a function of synchronization. This implies that synchronization makes information transport more efficient. In summary, our results reinforce the hypothesis that synchronization modulates neuronal interactions and provide further evidence that gamma band synchronization has behavioral relevance.}

The neural mechanism by which this {mPFC}-{lPFC} interaction occurs remains unknown. We hypothesized that transient synchronous oscillations in the theta range reflect a mechanism by which these structures interact. To test this hypothesis, we extracted oscillatory phase and power from current-source-density-transformed electroencephalographic data recorded during a Flanker task. Theta power in the {mPFC} was diminished on the trial preceding an error and increased immediately after an error, consistent with predictions of an action-monitoring system. These power dynamics appeared to take place over a response-related background of oscillatory theta phase coherence. Theta phase synchronization between {FCz} ({mPFC}) and F5/6 ({lPFC}) sites was robustly increased during error trials. The degree of {mPFC}-{lPFC} oscillatory synchronization predicted the degree of {mPFC} power on error trials, and both of these dynamics predicted the degree of posterror reaction time slowing. Oscillatory dynamics in the theta band may in part underlie a mechanism of communication between networks involved in action monitoring and cognitive control.}

abstract = {The brain can be regarded as a network: a connected system where nodes, or units, represent different specialized regions and links, or connections, represent communication pathways. From a functional perspective, communication is coded by temporal dependence between the activities of different brain areas. In the last decade, the abstract representation of the brain as a graph has allowed to visualize functional brain networks and describe their non-trivial topological properties in a compact and objective way. Nowadays, the use of graph analysis in translational neuroscience has become essential to quantify brain dysfunctions in terms of aberrant reconfiguration of functional brain networks. Despite its evident impact, graph analysis of functional brain networks is not a simple toolbox that can be blindly applied to brain signals. On the one hand, it requires the know-how of all the methodological steps of the pipeline that manipulate the input brain signals and extract the functional network properties. On the other hand, knowledge of the neural phenomenon under study is required to perform physiologically relevant analysis. The aim of this review is to provide practical indications to make sense of brain network analysis and contrast counterproductive attitudes. \copyright 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

It has become clear that simple activation studies are no longer sufficient. There is an urgent need to understand the brain as a complex structural and functional network. Interest in brain network studies has increased strongly with the advent of modern network theory and increasingly powerful investigative techniques such as "high-density {EEG}", {MEG}, functional and structural {MRI}. Modern network studies of the brain have demonstrated that healthy brains self-organize towards so-called "small-world networks" characterized by a combination of dense local connectivity and critical long-distance connections. In addition, normal brain networks display hierarchical modularity, and a connectivity backbone that consists of interconnected hub nodes. This complex architecture is believed to arise under genetic control and to underlie cognition and intelligence. Optimal brain network organization becomes disrupted in neurological disease in characteristic ways. This review gives an overview of modern network theory and its applications to healthy brain function and neurological disease, in particular using techniques from clinical neurophysiology, such as {EEG} and {MEG}.

We identify this as a homoclinic bifurcation of a saddle-focus fixed point which is embedded in the chaotic attractors. The transition is accompanied by intermittency, which obeys a universal scaling law for the average length of trajectory segments exhibiting only short interspike intervals with the distance from the onset of intermittency.

abstract = {I propose that synchronization affects communication between neuronal groups. Gamma-band (30-90 Hz) synchronization modulates excitation rapidly enough that it escapes the following inhibition and activates postsynaptic neurons effectively. Synchronization also ensures that a presynaptic activation pattern arrives at postsynaptic neurons in a temporally coordinated manner. At a postsynaptic neuron, multiple presynaptic groups converge, e.g., representing different stimuli. If a stimulus is selected by attention, its neuronal representation shows stronger and higher-frequency gamma-band synchronization. Thereby, the attended stimulus representation selectively entrains postsynaptic neurons. The entrainment creates sequences of short excitation and longer inhibition that are coordinated between pre- and postsynaptic groups to transmit the attended representation and shut out competing inputs. The predominantly bottom-up-directed gamma-band influences are controlled by predominantly top-down-directed alpha-beta-band (8-20 Hz) influences. Attention itself samples stimuli at a 7-8 Hz theta rhythm. Thus, several rhythms and their interplay render neuronal communication effective, precise, and selective.

abstract = {Brain imaging data are generally used to determine which brain regions are most active in an experimental paradigm or in a group of subjects. Theoretical considerations suggest that it would also be of interest to know which set of brain regions are most interactive in a given task or group of subjects. A subset of regions that are much more strongly interactive among themselves than with the rest of the brain is called here a functional cluster. Functional clustering can be assessed by calculating for each subset of brain regions a measure, the cluster index, obtained by dividing the statistical dependence within the subset by that between the subset and rest of the brain. A cluster index value near 1 indicates a homogeneous system, while a high cluster index indicates that a subset of brain regions forms a distinct functional cluster. Within a functional cluster, individual brain regions are ranked at the center or at the periphery according to their statistical dependence with the rest of that cluster. The applicability of this approach has been tested on {PET} data obtained from normal and schizophrenic subjects performing a set of cognitive tasks. Analysis of the data reveals evidence of functional clustering. A comparative evaluation of which regions are more peripheral or more central suggests distinct differences between the two groups of subjects. We consider the applicability of this analysis to data obtained with imaging modalities offering higher temporal resolution than {PET}.}

We compared the postsynaptic firing variability of type 1 {RS} and type 2 {FS} cells, during naturalistic, fluctuating conductance input. In {RS} neurons, increasing the level of independently random, shunting inhibition caused a monotonic increase in spike reliability, whereas in {FS} interneurons, there was an optimum level of shunting inhibition for achieving the most reliable spike generation and the most precise spike-time encoding. This was observed over a range of different degrees of synchrony, or correlation, in the input. {RS} cells displayed a progressive rise in spike jitter during natural-like transient burst inputs, whereas for {FS} cells, jitter was mostly kept low. Furthermore, {RS} cells showed encoding of the input level in the spike shape, whereas {FS} cells did not. These differences between the two cell types are consistent with a role of {RS} neurons as rate-coding integrators, and a role of {FS} neurons as resonators controlling the coherence of synchronous firing.}

abstract = {Neurons are exquisitely specialized for rapid electrical transmission of signals, but some properties of glial cells, which do not communicate with electrical impulses, are well suited for participating in complex cognitive functions requiring broad spatial integration and long-term temporal regulation. Astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes all have biological properties that could influence learning and cognition. Myelination by oligodendrocytes increases conduction velocity, affecting spike timing and oscillations in neuronal activity. Astrocytes can modulate synaptic transmission and may couple multiple neurons and synapses into functional assemblies. Microglia can remove synapses in an activity-dependent manner altering neural networks. Incorporating glia into a bicellular mechanism of nervous system function may help answer long-standing questions concerning the cellular mechanisms of learning and cognition. \copyright The Author(s) 2013.}

abstract = {A network of oscillatory bursting neurons with excitatory coupling is hypothesized to define the primary kernel for respiratory rhythm generation in the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-Bö{tC}) in mammals. Two minimal models of these neurons are proposed. In model 1, bursting arises via fast activation and slow inactivation of a persistent Na+ current {INaP}-h. In model 2, bursting arises via a fast-activating persistent Na+ current {INaP} and slow activation of a K+ current {IKS}. In both models, action potentials are generated via fast Na+ and K+ currents. The two models have few differences in parameters to facilitate a rigorous comparison of the two different burst-generating mechanisms. Both models are consistent with many of the dynamic features of electrophysiological recordings from pre-Bö{tC} oscillatory bursting neurons in vitro, including voltage-dependent activity modes (silence, bursting, and beating), a voltage-dependent burst frequency that can vary from 0.05 to \textgreater1 Hz, and a decaying spike frequency during bursting. These results are robust and persist across a wide range of parameter values for both models. However, the dynamics of model 1 are more consistent with experimental data in that the burst duration decreases as the baseline membrane potential is depolarized and the model has a relatively flat membrane potential trajectory during the interburst interval. We propose several experimental tests to demonstrate the validity of either model and to differentiate between the two mechanisms.}

abstract = {Electrical signaling in neurons is mediated by the opening and closing of large numbers of individual ion channels. The ion channels' state transitions are stochastic and introduce fluctuations in the macroscopic current through ion channel populations. This creates an unavoidable source of intrinsic electrical noise for the neuron, leading to fluctuations in the membrane potential and spontaneous spikes. While this effect is well known, the impact of channel noise on single neuron dynamics remains poorly understood. Most results are based on numerical simulations. There is no agreement, even in theoretical studies, on which ion channel type is the dominant noise source, nor how inclusion of additional ion channel types affects voltage noise. Here we describe a framework to calculate voltage noise directly from an arbitrary set of ion channel models, and discuss how this can be use to estimate spontaneous spike rates.}

abstract = {Spatio-temporally organized low-frequency fluctuations (\textless 0.1 Hz), observed in {BOLD} {fMRI} signal during rest, suggest the existence of underlying network dynamics that emerge spontaneously from intrinsic brain processes. Furthermore, significant correlations between distinct anatomical regions-or functional connectivity ({FC})-have led to the identification of several widely distributed resting-state networks ({RSNs}). This slow dynamics seems to be highly structured by anatomical connectivity but the mechanism behind it and its relationship with neural activity, particularly in the gamma frequency range, remains largely unknown. Indeed, direct measurements of neuronal activity have revealed similar large-scale correlations, particularly in slow power fluctuations of local field potential gamma frequency range oscillations. To address these questions, we investigated neural dynamics in a large-scale model of the human brain's neural activity. A key ingredient of the model was a structural brain network defined by empirically derived long-range brain connectivity together with the corresponding conduction delays. A neural population, assumed to spontaneously oscillate in the gamma frequency range, was placed at each network node. When these oscillatory units are integrated in the network, they behave as weakly coupled oscillators. The time-delayed interaction between nodes is described by the Kuramoto model of phase oscillators, a biologically-based model of coupled oscillatory systems. For a realistic setting of axonal conduction speed, we show that time-delayed network interaction leads to the emergence of slow neural activity fluctuations, whose patterns correlate significantly with the empirically measured {FC}. The best agreement of the simulated {FC} with the empirically measured {FC} is found for a set of parameters where subsets of nodes tend to synchronize although the network is not globally synchronized. Inside such clusters, the simulated {BOLD} signal between nodes is found to be correlated, instantiating the empirically observed {RSNs}. Between clusters, patterns of positive and negative correlations are observed, as described in experimental studies. These results are found to be robust with respect to a biologically plausible range of model parameters. In conclusion, our model suggests how resting-state neural activity can originate from the interplay between the local neural dynamics and the large-scale structure of the brain.

Diffusion anisotropy varied widely among different white matter regions, reflecting differences in fiber-tract architecture. In the corpus callosum and pyramidal tracts, the ratio of parallel to perpendicular diffusivities was approximately threefold higher than previously reported, and diffusion appeared cylindrically symmetric. However, in other white matter regions, particularly in the centrum semiovale, diffusion anisotropy was low, and cylindrical symmetry was not observed. Maps of parameters derived from D were also used to segment tissues based on their diffusion properties. {CONCLUSION}: A quantitative characterization of water diffusion in anisotropic, heterogeneously oriented tissues is clinically feasible. This should improve the neuroradiologic assessment of a variety of gray and white matter disorders.}

At the heart of this endeavor is the notion that brain connectivity can be abstracted to a graph of nodes, representing neural elements (e.g., neurons, brain regions), linked by edges, representing some measure of structural, functional or causal interaction between nodes. Such a representation brings connectomic data into the realm of graph theory, affording a rich repertoire of mathematical tools and concepts that can be used to characterize diverse anatomical and dynamical properties of brain networks. Although this approach has tremendous potential - and has seen rapid uptake in the neuroimaging community - it also has a number of pitfalls and unresolved challenges which can, if not approached with due caution, undermine the explanatory potential of the endeavor.

abstract = {The interplay between anatomical connectivity and dynamics in neural networks plays a key role in the functional properties of the brain and in the associated connectivity changes induced by neural diseases. However, a detailed experimental investigation of this interplay at both cellular and population scales in the living brain is limited by accessibility. Alternatively, to investigate the basic operational principles with morphological, electrophysiological and computational methods, the activity emerging from large in vitro networks of primary neurons organized with imposed topologies can be studied. Here, we validated the use of a new bio-printing approach, which effectively maintains the topology of hippocampal cultures in vitro and investigated, by patch-clamp and {MEA} electrophysiology, the emerging functional properties of these grid-confined networks. In spite of differences in the organization of physical connectivity, our bio-patterned grid networks retained the key properties of synaptic transmission, short-term plasticity and overall network activity with respect to random networks. Interestingly, the imposed grid topology resulted in a reinforcement of functional connections along orthogonal directions, shorter connectivity links and a greatly increased spiking probability in response to focal stimulation. These results clearly demonstrate that reliable functional studies can nowadays be performed on large neuronal networks in the presence of sustained changes in the physical network connectivity.}

However, little is known about the network of anatomical connections in the human brain. Here, we investigated large-scale anatomical connection patterns of the human cerebral cortex using cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance images. Two areas were considered anatomically connected if they showed statistically significant correlations in cortical thickness and we constructed the network of such connections using 124 brains from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping database. Significant short- and long-range connections were found in both intra- and interhemispheric regions, many of which were consistent with known neuroanatomical pathways measured by human diffusion imaging. More importantly, we showed that the human brain anatomical network had robust small-world properties with cohesive neighborhoods and short mean distances between regions that were insensitive to the selection of correlation thresholds. Additionally, we also found that this network and the probability of finding a connection between 2 regions for a given anatomical distance had both exponentially truncated power-law distributions. Our results demonstrated the basic organizational principles for the anatomical network in the human brain compatible with previous functional networks studies, which provides important implications of how functional brain states originate from their structural underpinnings. To our knowledge, this study provides the first report of small-world properties and degree distribution of anatomical networks in the human brain using cortical thickness measurements.}

These networks have also been applied to the gross neural connectivity between primate cortical areas and the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we extend this work to a specific neural circuit of the vertebrate brain--the medial reticular formation ({RF}) of the brainstem--and, in doing so, we have made three key contributions. First, this work constitutes the first model (and quantitative review) of this important brain structure for over three decades. Second, we have developed the first graph-theoretic analysis of vertebrate brain connectivity at the neural network level. Third, we propose simple metrics to quantitatively assess the extent to which the networks studied are small-world or scale-free. We conclude that the medial {RF} is configured to create small-world (implying coherent rapid-processing capabilities), but not scale-free, type networks under assumptions which are amenable to quantitative measurement.}

abstract = {Synchronization or phase-locking between oscillating neuronal groups is considered to be important for coordination of information among cortical networks. Spectral coherence is a commonly used approach to quantify phase locking between neural signals. We systematically explored the validity of spectral coherence measures for quantifying synchronization among neural oscillators. To that aim, we simulated coupled oscillatory signals that exhibited synchronization dynamics using an abstract phase-oscillator model as well as interacting gamma-generating spiking neural networks. We found that, within a large parameter range, the spectral coherence measure deviated substantially from the expected phase-locking. Moreover, spectral coherence did not converge to the expected value with increasing signal-to-noise ratio. We found that spectral coherence particularly failed when oscillators were in the partially (intermittent) synchronized state, which we expect to be the most likely state for neural synchronization. The failure was due to the fast frequency and amplitude changes induced by synchronization forces. We then investigated whether spectral coherence reflected the information flow among networks measured by transfer entropy ({TE}) of spike trains. We found that spectral coherence failed to robustly reflect changes in synchrony-mediated information flow between neural networks in many instances. As an alternative approach we explored a phase-locking value ({PLV}) method based on the reconstruction of the instantaneous phase. As one approach for reconstructing instantaneous phase, we used the Hilbert Transform ({HT}) preceded by Singular Spectrum Decomposition ({\SSD}) of the signal. {PLV} estimates have broad applicability as they do not rely on stationarity, and, unlike spectral coherence, they enable more accurate estimations of oscillatory synchronization across a wide range of different synchronization regimes, and better tracking of synchronization-mediated information flow among networks.}

There is compelling evidence that the bursts are intrinsically generated by summation of large spike afterdepolarizations ({ADPs}). Using intracellular recordings in adult rat hippocampal slices, we show that intrinsic burst-firing in {CA1} {PCs} is strongly dependent on the extracellular concentration of Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](o)). Thus, lowering [Ca(2+)](o) (by equimolar substitution with Mn(2+) or Mg(2+)) induced intrinsic bursting in nonbursters, whereas raising [Ca(2+)](o) suppressed intrinsic bursting in native bursters. The induction of intrinsic bursting by low [Ca(2+)](o) was associated with enlargement of the spike {ADP}. Low [Ca(2+)](o)-induced intrinsic bursts and their underlying {ADPs} were suppressed by drugs that reduce the persistent Na(+) current (I({NaP})), indicating that this current mediates the slow burst depolarization. Blocking Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents with extracellular Ni(2+) or intracellular chelation of Ca(2+) did not induce intrinsic bursting. This and other evidence suggest that lowering [Ca(2+)](o) may induce intrinsic bursting by augmenting I({NaP}). Because repetitive neuronal activity in the hippocampus is associated with marked decreases in [Ca(2+)](o), the regulation of intrinsic bursting by extracellular Ca(2+) may provide a mechanism for preferential recruitment of this firing mode during certain forms of hippocampal activation.}

abstract = {In this paper we study the small-world network model of Watts and Strogatz, which mimics some aspects of the structure of networks of social interactions. We argue that there is one nontrivial length-scale in the model, analogous to the correlation length in other systems, which is well-defined in the limit of infinite system size and which diverges continuously as the randomness in the network tends to zero, giving a normal critical point in this limit. This length-scale governs the crossover from large- to small-world behavior in the model, as well as the number of vertices in a neighborhood of given radius on the network. We derive the value of the single critical exponent controlling behavior in the critical region and the finite size scaling form for the average vertex-vertex distance on the network, and, using series expansion and Padé approximants, find an approximate analytic form for the scaling function. We calculate the effective dimension of small-world graphs and show that this dimension varies as a function of the length-scale on which it is measured, in a manner reminiscent of multifractals. We also study the problem of site percolation on small-world networks as a simple model of disease propagation, and derive an approximate expression for the percolation probability at which a giant component of connected vertices first forms (in epidemiological terms, the point at which an epidemic occurs). The typical cluster radius satisfies the expected finite size scaling form with a cluster size exponent close to that for a random graph. All our analytic results are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations of the model.}

abstract = {Arrays of identical oscillators can display a remarkable spatiotemporal pattern in which phase-locked oscillators coexist with drifting ones. Discovered two years ago, such "chimera states" are believed to be impossible for locally or globally coupled systems; they are peculiar to the intermediate case of nonlocal coupling. Here we present an exact solution for this state, for a ring of phase oscillators coupled by a cosine kernel. We show that the stable chimera state bifurcates from a spatially modulated drift state, and dies in a saddle-node bifurcation with an unstable chimera state.}

abstract = {Autism is often described as a disorder of neural synchronization. However, it is unknown how early in development synchronization abnormalities emerge and whether they are related to the development of early autistic behavioral symptoms. Here, we show that disrupted synchronization is evident in the spontaneous cortical activity of naturally sleeping toddlers with autism, but not in toddlers with language delay or typical development. Toddlers with autism exhibited significantly weaker interhemispheric synchronization (i.e., weak "functional connectivity" across the two hemispheres) in putative language areas. The strength of synchronization was positively correlated with verbal ability and negatively correlated with autism severity, and it enabled identification of the majority of autistic toddlers (72\%) with high accuracy (84\%). Disrupted cortical synchronization, therefore, appears to be a notable characteristic of autism neurophysiology that is evident at very early stages of autism development.

abstract = {The motor signs of Parkinson's disease are thought to result in large part from a reduction of the level of dopamine in the basal ganglia. Over the last few years, many of the functional and anatomical consequences of dopamine loss in these structures have been identified, both in the basal ganglia and in related areas in thalamus and cortex. This knowledge has contributed significantly to our understanding of the link between the degeneration of dopamine neurons in the midbrain and the development of parkinsonism. This review discusses the evidence that implicates electrophysiologic changes (including altered discharge rates, increased incidence of burst firing, interneuronal synchrony, oscillatory activity, and altered sensorimotor processing) in basal ganglia, thalamus, and cortex, in parkinsonism. From these studies, parkinsonism emerges as a complex network disorder, in which abnormal activity in groups of neurons in the basal ganglia strongly affects the excitability, oscillatory activity, synchrony and sensory responses of areas of the cerebral cortex that are involved in the planning and execution of movement, as well as in executive, limbic or sensory functions. Detailed knowledge of these changes will help us to develop more effective and specific symptomatic treatments for patients with Parkinson's disease.}

abstract = {Considerable effort has gone into understanding the mechanisms underlying high-frequency 'bursting' of thalamocortical impulses, their sensory information content and their involvement in perception. However, little is known about the influence of such impulses on their cortical targets. Here we follow bursting thalamic impulses to their terminus at the thalamocortical synapse of the awake rabbit, and examine their influence on a class of somatosensory cortical neurons. We show that thalamic bursts potently activate cortical circuits. Initial impulses of each burst have a greatly enhanced ability to elicit cortical action potentials, and later impulses in the burst further raise the probability of eliciting spikes. In some cases, multiple cortical spikes result from a single burst. Moreover, we show that the interval preceding each burst is crucial for generating the enhanced cortical response. The powerful activation of neocortex by thalamocortical bursts is fully consistent with an involvement of these impulses in perceptual/attentional processes.}

Here we show reduced, behaviourally driven gamma oscillations before the onset of plaque formation or cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Optogenetically driving fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive ({FS}-{PV})-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, reduces levels of amyloid-\beta (A\beta)1-40 and A\beta 1-42 isoforms. Gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological transformation of microglia, and histological analysis confirmed increased microglia co-localization with A\beta. Subsequently, we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced A\beta1-40 and A\beta1-42 levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma rhythms in recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate Alzheimer's-disease-associated pathology.}

abstract = {Understanding how the brain learns to compute functions reliably, efficiently, and robustly with noisy spiking activity is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Most sensory and motor tasks can be described as dynamical systems and could presumably be learned by adjusting connection weights in a recurrent biological neural network. However, this is greatly complicated by the credit assignment problem for learning in recurrent networks, e.g., the contribution of each connection to the global output error cannot be determined based only on locally accessible quantities to the synapse. Combining tools from adaptive control theory and efficient coding theories, we propose that neural circuits can indeed learn complex dynamic tasks with local synaptic plasticity rules as long as they associate two experimentally established neural mechanisms. First, they should receive top-down feedbacks driving both their activity and their synaptic plasticity. Second, inhibitory interneurons should maintain a tight balance between excitation and inhibition in the circuit. The resulting networks could learn arbitrary dynamical systems and produce irregular spike trains as variable as those observed experimentally. Yet, this variability in single neurons may hide an extremely efficient and robust computation at the population level. Copyright \copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {The Julia programming language is gaining enormous popularity. Julia was designed to be easy and fast. Most importantly, Julia shatters deeply established notions widely held in the applied community: 1. High-level, dynamic code has to be slow by some sort of law of nature 2. It is sensible to prototype in one language and then recode in another language 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. Julia began with a deep understanding of the needs of the scientic programmer and the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from computer science and computational science creating a new approach to scientic computing. This note introduces the programmer to the language and the underlying design theory. It invites the reader to rethink the fundamental foundations of numerical computing systems. In particular, there is the fascinating dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. We can pick just the right algorithm for the right circumstance and this can happen at runtime based on argument types (code selection via multiple dispatch). Abstraction recognizes what remains the same after dierences are stripped away and ignored as irrelevant. The recognition of abstraction allows for code reuse (generic programming). A simple idea that yields incredible power. The Julia design facilitates this interplay in many explicit and subtle ways for machine performance and, most importantly, human convenience.}

abstract = {Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls.}

abstract = {Spontaneous brain activity at rest is spatially and temporally organized in networks of cortical and subcortical regions specialized for different functional domains. Even though brain networks were first studied individually through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, more recent studies focused on their dynamic 'integration'. Integration depends on two fundamental properties: the structural topology of brain networks and the dynamics of functional connectivity. In this scenario, cortical hub regions, that are central regions highly connected with other areas of the brain, play a fundamental role in serving as way stations for network traffic. In this review, we focus on the functional organization of a set of hub areas that we define as the 'dynamic core'. In the resting state, these regions dynamically interact with other regions of the brain linking multiple networks. First, we introduce and compare the statistical measures used for detecting hubs. Second, we discuss their identification based on different methods (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Diffusion Weighted Imaging, Electro/Magneto Encephalography). Third, we show that the degree of interaction between these core regions and the rest of the brain varies over time, indicating that their centrality is not stationary. Moreover, alternating periods of strong and weak centrality of the core relate to periods of strong and weak global efficiency in the brain. These results indicate that information processing in the brain is not stable, but fluctuates and its temporal and spectral properties are discussed. In particular, the hypothesis of 'pulsed' information processing, discovered in the slow temporal scale, is explored for signals at higher temporal resolution. Copyright \copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We assume that some epileptic neural network are bistable i.e., they feature two operational states, ictal and interictal that co-exist. The transitions between these two states may occur according to a Poisson process, a random walk process or as a result of deterministic time-dependent mechanisms. We analyze data from animal models of absence epilepsy, human epilepsies and in vitro models. The distributions of durations of ictal and interictal epochs are fitted with a gamma distribution. On the basis of qualitative features of the fits, we identify the dynamical processes that may have generated the underlying data. The analysis showed that the following hold. 1) The dynamics of ictal epochs differ from those of interictal states. 2) Seizure initiation can be accounted for by a random walk process while seizure termination is often mediated by deterministic mechanisms. 3) In certain cases, the transitions between ictal and interictal states can be modeled by a Poisson process operating in a bistable network. These results imply that exact prediction of seizure occurrence is not possible but termination of an ictal state by appropriate counter stimulation might be feasible.}

We used structural and functional neuroimaging data to construct whole- brain models. With this novel approach, we reveal that the human brain during resting state operates at maximum metastability, i.e. in a state of maximum network switching. In addition, we investigate cortical heterogeneity across areas. Optimization of the spectral characteristics of each local brain region revealed the dynamical cortical core of the human brain, which is driving the activity of the rest of the whole brain. Brain network modelling goes beyond correlational neuroimaging analysis and reveals non-trivial network mechanisms underlying non-invasive observations.

abstract = {The scientific study of human consciousness has greatly benefited from the development of non-invasive brain imaging methods. The quest to identify the neural correlates of consciousness combined psychophysical experimentation with neuroimaging tools such as functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to map the changes in neural activity associated with conscious vs. unconscious percepts. Different neuroimaging methods have also been applied to characterize spontaneous brain activity fluctuations during altered states of consciousness, and to develop quantitative metrics for the level of consciousness. Most of these studies, however, have not explored the dynamic nature of the whole-brain imaging data provided by {fMRI}. A series of empirical and computational studies strongly suggests that the temporal fluctuations observed in this data present a non-trivial structure, and that this structure is compatible with the exploration of a discrete repertoire of states. In this review we focus on how dynamic neuroimaging can be used to address theoretical accounts of consciousness based on the hypothesis of a dynamic core, i.e. a constantly evolving and transiently stable set of coordinated neurons that constitute an integrated and differentiated physical substrate for each conscious experience. We review work exploring the possibility that metastability in brain dynamics leads to a repertoire of dynamic core states, and discuss how it might be modified during altered states of consciousness. This discussion prompts us to review neuroimaging studies aimed to map the dynamic exploration of the repertoire of states as a function of consciousness. Complementary studies of the dynamic core hypothesis using perturbative methods are also discussed. Finally, we propose that a link between metastability in brain dynamics and the level of consciousness could pave the way towards a mechanistic understanding of altered states of consciousness using tools from dynamical systems theory and statistical physics.

Considering the emergence of numerous models and fiber tracking techniques, we herein aimed to compare, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the fiber tracking results of four {DTI} software (Brainance, Philips {FiberTrak}, {DSI} Studio, {NordicICE}) on the reconstruction of representative {WM} tracts. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Ten healthy participants underwent 30-directional diffusion tensor imaging on a {3T}-Philips Achieva {TX} {MR}-scanner. All data were analyzed by two independent sites of experienced raters with the aforementioned software and the following {WM} tracts were reconstructed: corticospinal tract ({CST}); forceps major (Fmajor); forceps minor (Fminor); cingulum bundle ({CB}); superior longitudinal fasciculus ({SLF}); inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus ({IFOF}). Visual inspection of the resulted tracts and statistical analysis (inter-rater and betweensoftware agreement; paired t-test) on fractional anisotropy ({FA}), axial and radial diffusivity (Daxial, Dradial) were applied for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of {DTI} software results. {RESULTS}: Qualitative evaluation of the extracted tracts confirmed anatomical landmarks at least for the core part of each tract, even though differences in the number of fibers extracted and the whole tract were evident, especially for the {CST}, Fmajor, Fminor and {SLF}. Descriptive values did not deviate from the expected range of values for healthy adult population. Substantial inter-rater agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient [{ICC}], Bland-Altman analysis) was found for all tracts ({ICC}; {FA}: 0.839-0.989, Daxial: 0.704-0.991, Dradial: 0.972-0.993). Low agreement for {FA}, Daxial and Dradial ({ICC}; Bland-Altman analysis) and significant paired t-test differences (p \textless  0.05) were detected regarding between-software agreement. {CONCLUSIONS}: Qualitative comparison of four different {DTI} software in addition to substantial inter-rater but poor between-software agreement highlight the differences on existing fiber tracking methodologies and several particularities of each {WM} tract, further supporting the need for further study in both clinical and research settings.}

abstract = {At the macroscopic scale, the human brain can be described as a complex network of white matter tracts integrating grey matter assemblies - the human connectome. The structure of the connectome, which is often described using graph theoretic approaches, can be used to model macroscopic brain function at low computational cost. Here, we use the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators with time-delays, calibrated with respect to empirical functional {MRI} data, to study the relation between the structure of the connectome and two aspects of functional brain dynamics - synchrony, a measure of general coherence, and metastability, a measure of dynamical flexibility. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the local structure of the connectome, quantified using graph theory, and the synchrony and metastability of the model's dynamics. By removing individual nodes and all of their connections from the model, we study the effect of lesions on both global and local dynamics. Of the nine nodal graph-theoretical properties tested, two were able to predict effects of node lesion on the global dynamics. The removal of nodes with high eigenvector centrality leads to decreases in global synchrony and increases in global metastability, as does the removal of hub nodes joining topologically segregated network modules. At the level of local dynamics in the neighbourhood of the lesioned node, structural properties of the lesioned nodes hold more predictive power, as five nodal graph theoretical measures are related to changes in local dynamics following node lesions. We discuss these results in the context of empirical studies of stroke and functional brain dynamics. Copyright \copyright 2015. Published by Elsevier Inc.}

abstract = {Chimera states, namely the coexistence of coherent and incoherent behavior, were previously analyzed in complex networks. However, they have not been extensively studied in modular networks. Here, we consider a neural network inspired by the connectome of the C. elegans soil worm, organized into six interconnected communities, where neurons obey chaotic bursting dynamics. Neurons are assumed to be connected with electrical synapses within their communities and with chemical synapses across them. As our numerical simulations reveal, the coaction of these two types of coupling can shape the dynamics in such a way that chimera-like states can happen. They consist of a fraction of synchronized neurons which belong to the larger communities, and a fraction of desynchronized neurons which are part of smaller communities. In addition to the Kuramoto order parameter \rho, we also employ other measures of coherence, such as the chimera-like \chi and metastability \lambda indices, which quantify the degree of synchronization among communities and along time, respectively. We perform the same analysis for networks that share common features with the C. elegans neural network. Similar results suggest that under certain assumptions, chimera-like states are prominent phenomena in modular networks, and might provide insight for the behavior of more complex modular networks.}

abstract = {This highly respected, frequently cited book addresses two exciting fields: pattern formation and synchronization of oscillators. It systematically develops the dynamics of many-oscillator systems of dissipative type, with special emphasis on oscillating reaction-diffusion systems. The author applies the reductive perturbation method and the phase description method to the onset of collective rhythms, the formation of wave patterns, and diffusion-induced chemical turbulence. This two-part treatment starts with a section on methods, defining and exploring the reductive perturbation method \textemdash oscillators versus fields of oscillators, the Stuart-Landau equation, onset of oscillations in distributed systems, and the Ginzburg-Landau equations. It further examines methods of phase description, including systems of weakly coupled oscillators, one-oscillator problems, nonlinear phase diffusion equations, and representation by the Floquet eigenvectors. Additional methods include systematic perturbation expansion, generalization of the nonlinear phase diffusion equation, and the dynamics of both slowly varying wavefronts and slowly phase-modulated periodic waves. The second part illustrates applications, from mutual entrainment to chemical waves and chemical turbulence. The text concludes with a pair of convenient appendixes.}

abstract = {The Hodgkin and Huxley ({HH}) model predicts sustained repetitive firing of nerve action potentials for a suprathreshold depolarizing current pulse for as long as the pulse is applied (type 2 excitability). Squid giant axons, the preparation for which the model was intended, fire only once at the beginning of the pulse (type 3 behaviour). This discrepancy between the theory and experiments can be removed by modifying a single parameter in the {HH} equations for the K+ current as determined from the analysis in this paper. K+ currents in general have been described by {IK}={gK}(V-{EK}), where {gK} is the membrane's K+ current conductance and {EK} is the K+ Nernst potential. However, {IK} has a nonlinear dependence on (V-{EK}) well described by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation that determines the voltage dependence of {gK}. This experimental finding is the basis for the modification in the {HH} equations describing type 3 behaviour. Our analysis may have broad significance given the use of {IK}={gK}(V-{EK}) to describe K+ currents in a wide variety of biological preparations.}

abstract = {In the last decade, there has been a growing body of literature addressing the utilization of complex network methods for the characterization of dynamical systems based on time series. While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems. The overall aim of this report is to provide the readers with the knowledge how the complex network approaches can be applied to their own field of real-world time series analysis.}

abstract = {Spatiotemporal chaos and turbulence are universal concepts for the explanation of irregular behavior in various physical systems. Recently, a remarkable new phenomenon, called "chimera states," has been described, where in a spatially homogeneous system, regions of irregular incoherent motion coexist with regular synchronized motion, forming a self-organized pattern in a population of nonlocally coupled oscillators. Whereas most previous studies of chimera states focused their attention on the case of large numbers of oscillators employing the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many oscillators, here we investigate the properties of chimera states in populations of finite size using concepts from deterministic chaos. Our calculations of the Lyapunov spectrum show that the incoherent motion, which is described in the thermodynamic limit as a stationary behavior, in finite size systems appears as weak spatially extensive chaos. Moreover, for sufficiently small populations the chimera states reveal their transient nature: after a certain time span we observe a sudden collapse of the chimera pattern and a transition to the completely coherent state. Our results indicate that chimera states can be considered as chaotic transients, showing the same properties as type-{II} supertransients in coupled map lattices.}

abstract = {Several neurological diseases (e.g. essential tremor and Parkinson's disease) are related to pathologically enhanced synchronization of bursting neurons. Suppression of these synchronized rhythms has potential implications in electrical deep-brain stimulation research. We consider a simplified model of a neuronal network where the local dynamics presents a bursting timescale, and the connection architecture displays the scale-free property (power-law distribution of connectivity). The networks exhibit collective oscillations in the form of synchronized bursting rhythms, without affecting the fast timescale dynamics. We investigate the suppression of these synchronized oscillations using a feedback control in the form of a time-delayed signal. We located domains of bursting synchronization suppression in terms of perturbation strength and time delay, and present computational evidence that synchronization suppression is easier in scale-free networks than in the more commonly studied global (mean-field) networks.}

abstract = {How do neurons encode long-term memories? Bilateral imaging of neuronal activity in the mouse hippocampus reveals that, from one day to the next, \~40\% of neurons change their responsiveness to cues, but thereafter only 1\% of cells change per day. Despite these changes, neuronal responses are resilient to a lack of exposure to a previously completed task or to hippocampus lesions. Unlike individual neurons, the responses of which change after a few days, groups of neurons with inter- and intrahemispheric synchronous activity show stable responses for several weeks. The likelihood that a neuron maintains its responsiveness across days is proportional to the number of neurons with which its activity is synchronous. Information stored in individual neurons is relatively labile, but it can be reliably stored in networks of synchronously active neurons.

abstract = {Arousals can be roughly characterized by punctual intrusions of wakefulness into sleep. In a standard perspective, using human electroencephalography ({EEG}) data, arousals are associated to slow-wave rhythms and K-complex brain activity. The physiological mechanisms that give rise to arousals during sleep are not yet fully understood. Moreover, subtle body movement patterns, which may characterize arousals both in human and in animals, are usually not detectable by eye perception and are not in general present in sleep studies. In this paper, we focus attention on accelerometer records ({AR}) to characterize and predict arousal during slow wave sleep ({SWS}) stage of mice. Furthermore, we recorded the local field potentials ({LFP}) from the {CA1} region in the hippocampus and paired with accelerometer data. The hippocampus signal was also used here to identify the {SWS} stage. We analyzed the {AR} dynamics of consecutive arousals using recurrence technique and the determinism ({DET}) quantifier. Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterize time series properties. The {DET} index evaluates how similar are the evolution of close trajectories: in this sense, it computes how accurate are predictions based on past trajectories. For all analyzed mice in this work, we observed, for the first time, the occurrence of a universal dynamic pattern a few seconds that precedes the arousals during {SWS} sleep stage based only on the {AR} signal. The predictability success of an arousal using {DET} from {AR} is nearly 90\%, while similar analysis using {LFP} of hippocampus brain region reveal 88\% of success. Noteworthy, our findings suggest an unique dynamical behavior pattern preceding an arousal of {AR} data during sleep. Thus, the employment of this technique applied to {AR} data may provide useful information about the dynamics of neuronal activities that control sleep-waking switch during {SWS} sleep period. We argue that the predictability of arousals observed through {DET}({AR}) can be functionally explained by a respiratory-driven modification of neural states. Finally, we believe that the method associating {AR} data with other physiologic events such as neural rhythms can become an accurate, convenient and non-invasive way of studying the physiology and physiopathology of movement and respiratory processes during sleep.}

G. 1975. Nature. 253:450-452). However, the bursting dynamics of trigeminal interneurons is inconsistent with the traditional mechanisms, and is far more effectively explained by a new model of bursting that exploits the unique stability properties associated with spike threshold (Baer, S.

abstract = {We study the stability of asymptotic states displayed by a complex neural network. We focus on the loss of stability of a stationary state of networks using recurrence quantifiers as tools to diagnose local and global stabilities as well as the multistability of a coupled neural network. Numerical simulations of a neural network composed of 1024 neurons in a small-world connection scheme are performed using the model of Braun et al. [Int. J. Bifurcation Chaos 08, 881 (1998){IJBEE40218}-127410.1142/S0218127498000681], which is a modified model from the Hodgkin-Huxley model [J. Phys. 117, 500 (1952)]. To validate the analyses, the results are compared with those produced by Kuramoto's order parameter [Chemical Oscillations, Waves, and Turbulence (Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, 1984)]. We show that recurrence tools making use of just integrated signals provided by the networks, such as local field potential ({LFP}) ({LFP} signals) or mean field values bring new results on the understanding of neural behavior occurring before the synchronization states. In particular we show the occurrence of different stationary and nonstationarity asymptotic states.}

abstract = {We considered a clustered network of bursting neurons described by the Huber-Braun model. In the upper level of the network we used the connectivity matrix of the cat cerebral cortex network, and in the lower level each cortex area (or cluster) is modelled as a small-world network. There are two different coupling strengths related to inter- and intracluster dynamics. Each bursting cycle is composed of a quiescent period followed by a rapid chaotic sequence of spikes, and we defined a geometric phase which enables us to investigate the onset of synchronized bursting, as the state in which the neuron start bursting at the same time, whereas their spikes may remain uncorrelated. The bursting synchronization of a clustered network has been investigated using an order parameter and the average field of the network in order to identify regimes in which each cluster may display synchronized behavior, whereas the overall network does not. We introduce quantifiers to evaluate the relative contribution of each cluster in the partial synchronized behavior of the whole network. Our main finding is that we typically observe in the clustered network not a complete phase synchronized regime but instead a complex pattern of partial phase synchronization in which different cortical areas may be internally synchronized at distinct phase values, hence they are not externally synchronized, unless the coupling strengths are too large.}

The two states are stationary solutions corresponding to different wave energies. In the language of (Fourier-mode) phase space these states are embedded in two invariant manifolds that become transversely unstable in the regime where two-state on-off intermittency sets in. The distribution of laminar duration sizes is compatible with the similar phenomenon occurring in time only in the presence of noise. In an extended system the noisy effect is provided by the spatial modes excited by the perturbation. We show that this intermittency is a precursor of the onset of strong turbulence in the system.}

Synchronization of bursting activity is possible in networks of coupled neurons, and it is sometimes an undesirable feature. Control procedures can suppress totally or partially this collective behavior, with potential applications in deep-brain stimulation techniques. We investigate the control of bursting synchronization in small-world networks of Hodgkin-Huxley-type thermally sensitive neurons with chemical synapses through two different strategies. One is the application of an external time-periodic electrical signal and another consists of a time-delayed feedback signal. We consider the effectiveness of both strategies in terms of protocols of applications suitable to be applied by pacemakers.}

abstract = {Functional brain networks are composed of cortical areas that are anatomically and functionally connected. One of the cortical networks for which more information is available in the literature is the cat cerebral cortex. Statistical analyses of the latter suggest that its structure can be described as a clustered network, in which each cluster is a scale-free network possessing highly connected hubs. Those hubs are, on their hand, connected together in a strong fashion ("rich-club" network). We have built a clustered scale-free network inspired in the cat cortex structure so as to study their dynamical properties. In this article, we focus on the synchronization of bursting activity of the cortical areas and how it can be suppressed by means of neuron deactivation through suitably applied light pulses. We show that it is possible to effectively suppress bursting synchronization by acting on a single, yet suitably chosen neuron, as long as it is highly connected, thanks to the "rich-club" structure of the network.}

abstract = {Spontaneous afferent activity was recorded from 26 single ampullary electroreceptive organs of freshwater catfish (Ictalurus nebulosus {LeS}) at various temperatures. Regular grouping of action potentials was apparent in this secondary sensory system at 35 degrees C and occasionally at 30 degrees C. Impulse groups consisted of up to seven impulses. The precise timing of impulse generation and the temporal sequence of impulses indicated that oscillating processes are involved. Expectation density functions were calculated for records of afferent activity obtained at various temperatures below 35 degrees C. In the majority of records the function was periodic. Impulse grouping and expectation density functions became more distinct in units exhibiting extremely high thresholds (i.e. being insensitive) to electrical stimuli. The results suggest that the oscillations originate from the postsynaptic membrane. The temporal pattern of impulse generation within impulse groups of ampullary electroreceptor organs and of specific warm and cold receptors was compared and found to be similar. Application of cadmium and menthol, which both reduce calcium entry, suppressed spontaneous activity in normal and insensitive electroreceptor systems, attenuated the sensitivity of normal receptors and modified the periodic pattern. This indicates that calcium is implicated in sensory transduction and in postsynaptic mechanisms. The data suggest that an oscillating process is one component of signal transmission in ampullary electroreceptor organs of teleost fish.}

These oscillators (used for modeling neuronal dynamics) are essentially multiple time scale systems. We show that a transition to mutual phase synchronization takes place on the bursting time scale of globally coupled oscillators, while on the spiking time scale, they behave asynchronously. We also demonstrate the effect of the onset of external chaotic phase synchronization of the bursting behavior in the studied ensemble by a periodic driving applied to one arbitrarily taken neuron. We also propose an explanation of the mechanism behind this effect. We infer that the demonstrated phenomenon can be used efficiently for controlling bursting activity in neural ensembles.}

In this paper, the cerebral cortex is described as a network of networks (cortex network), we consider that each cortical area is composed of a network with small-world property (cortical network). The neurons are assumed to have bursting properties with the dynamics described by the Rulkov model. We study the phase synchronization of the cortex network and the cortical networks. In our simulations, we verify that synchronization in cortex network is not homogeneous. Besides, we focus on the suppression of neural phase synchronization. Synchronization can be related to undesired and pathological abnormal rhythms in the brain. For this reason, we consider the delayed feedback control to suppress the synchronization. We show that delayed feedback control is efficient to suppress synchronous behavior in our network model when an appropriate signal intensity and time delay are defined.}

abstract = {Abstract The transition to phase synchronized states of neural networks with bursting dynamics may have nonstationary characteristics, as well as sensitivity to initial conditions. Here, we analyze the paradigmatic network composed of neurons of Rulkov to investigate dynamic properties of the transitions to phase synchronization displayed by networks under two different topologies of the connection matrices, namely, small-world and random ones. Our analyses of both connection architectures reveal that neural networks under small-world topology display higher sensibility to initial conditions, and contrarily to the random connection case, depict a nonstationary transition to phase synchronization through the presence of a two-state on–off intermittency. The analyses are based on the recurrence quantifier determinism calculated by using only the local (mean) field potential ({LFP}) of the network, an experimentally easy accessible data. The use of {LFP} data offers advantages in the quantification of the nonstationary dynamics at the transition to phase synchronized states, since the more traditional Kuramoto order parameter must be computed over the individual signals of the neurons.}

As an example of collective phenomena emerging from the interactions of multiple dynamical processes, we study a model where neural dynamics and nutrient transport are bidirectionally coupled in such a way that the allocation of the transport process at one layer depends on the degree of synchronization at the other layer, and vice versa. We show numerically, and we prove analytically, that the multilayer coupling induces a spontaneous explosive synchronization and a heterogeneous distribution of allocations, otherwise not present in the two systems considered separately. Our framework can find application to other cases where two or more dynamical processes such as synchronization, opinion formation, information diffusion, or disease spreading, are interacting with each other.}

abstract = {Anomalous phase synchronization describes a synchronization phenomenon occurring even for the weakly coupled network and characterized by a non-monotonous dependence of the synchronization strength on the coupling strength. Its existence may support a theoretical framework to some neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's and some episodes of seizure behavior generated by epilepsy. Despite the success of controlling or suppressing the anomalous phase synchronization in neural networks applying external perturbations or inducing ambient changes, the origin of the anomalous phase synchronization as well as the mechanisms behind the suppression is not completely known. Here, we consider networks composed of N=2000 coupled neurons in a small-world topology for two well known neuron models, namely, the Hodgkin-Huxley-like and the Hindmarsh-Rose models, both displaying the anomalous phase synchronization regime. We show that the anomalous phase synchronization may be related to the individual behavior of the coupled neurons; particularly, we identify a strong correlation between the behavior of the inter-bursting-intervals of the neurons, what we call neuron variability, to the ability of the network to depict anomalous phase synchronization. We corroborate the ideas showing that external perturbations or ambient parameter changes that eliminate anomalous phase synchronization and at the same time promote small changes in the individual dynamics of the neurons, such that an increasing individual variability of neurons implies a decrease of anomalous phase synchronization. Finally, we demonstrate that this effect can be quantified using a well known recurrence quantifier, the "determinism." Moreover, the results obtained by the determinism are based on only the mean field potential of the network, turning these measures more suitable to be used in experimental situations.}

abstract = {Chaotic dynamics has been shown in the dynamics of neurons and neural networks, in experimental data and numerical simulations. Theoretical studies have proposed an underlying role of chaos in neural systems. Nevertheless, whether chaotic neural oscillators make a significant contribution to network behaviour and whether the dynamical richness of neural networks is sensitive to the dynamics of isolated neurons, still remain open questions. We investigated synchronization transitions in heterogeneous neural networks of neurons connected by electrical coupling in a small world topology. The nodes in our model are oscillatory neurons that - when isolated - can exhibit either chaotic or non-chaotic behaviour, depending on conductance parameters. We found that the heterogeneity of firing rates and firing patterns make a greater contribution than chaos to the steepness of the synchronization transition curve. We also show that chaotic dynamics of the isolated neurons do not always make a visible difference in the transition to full synchrony. Moreover, macroscopic chaos is observed regardless of the dynamics nature of the neurons. However, performing a Functional Connectivity Dynamics analysis, we show that chaotic nodes can promote what is known as multi-stable behaviour, where the network dynamically switches between a number of different semi-synchronized, metastable states.}

First, we found substantial differences between the activity dynamics of beetles and ants, with the results suggesting that the beetles have quasi-periodic dynamics and the ants do not. Second, workers from different ant species varied with respect to their dynamics, presenting degrees of predictability as well as stochastic signals. Finally, differences were found among minor and major caste of the same (dimorphic) ant species.

In this work we study numerically the effects that a third {LCO} induces to the collective behavior of the system. We analyze the new system by dealing with directed heterogeneous couplings among the units. We report a novel and robust phenomenon, absent when coupling two {LCOs}, which consists of a discontinuous relationship between the synchronization time and coupling strength or initial conditions. The mechanism responsible for the appearance of such discontinuities is discussed.}

We consider a network composed of 78 neural subareas (subnetworks) coupled with a mean-field potential scheme. Each subnetwork is characterized by a small-world topology, composed of 250 bursting neurons simulated through a Rulkov model. Using the Kuramoto order parameter we demonstrate that healthy and Alzheimer-affected brains display distinct phase synchronization and intermittence properties as a function of internal and external coupling strengths. In general, for the healthy case, each subnetwork develops a substantial level of internal synchronization before a global stable phase-synchronization state has been established. For the unhealthy case, despite the similar internal subnetwork synchronization levels, we identify higher levels of global phase synchronization occurring even for relatively small internal and external coupling. Using recurrence quantification analysis, namely the determinism of the mean-field potential, we identify regions where the healthy and unhealthy networks depict nonstationary behavior, but the results denounce the presence of a larger region or intermittent dynamics for the case of Alzheimer-affected networks. A possible theoretical explanation based on two locally stable but globally unstable states is discussed.}

abstract = {Abstract We examine two main behaviors including, firing activity and neuronal synchronization in a Hindmarsh–Rose neural network under magnetic stimulation. We use the theory of bifurcation analysis to seek the control parameters domains in which neuronal activity is set up. The statistical synchronization factor is recorded in order to evaluate the network synchronicity degree. The firing activity is found to be favorable when the values of control parameters, namely the magnetic coupling strength and the external electromagnetic induction, are between low-threshold and upper-threshold and unfavorable elsewhere. Additionally, the increase of electrical coupling strength drastically reduces the domain of control parameters where neuronal synchronization is expected. Our findings suggest that a rich neuronal activity including quiescent state, spiking/bursting regimes, amplitude death phenomenon and global synchronization may be efficiently regulated by electromagnetic induction of intra-and extracellular media of thalamic neurons.}

abstract = {The human cerebral cortex can be separated into cortical areas forming a clustered network structure. We build two different clustered networks, where one network is based on a healthy brain and the other according to a brain affected by a neurodegenerative process. Each cortical area has a subnetwork with small-world properties. We verify that both networks exhibit rich-club organisation and phase synchronisation. Due to the fact that neuronal synchronisation can be related to brain diseases, we consider the delayed feedback control as a method to suppress synchronous behaviours. In this work, it is presented that depending on the feedback parameters, intensity and time delay, phase synchronisation in both networks can be suppressed. Therefore, one of our main results is to show that delayed feedback control can be used to suppress undesired synchronous behaviours not only in the healthy brain, but also in the brain marked by neurodegenerative processes.}

Among these phenomena, the synchronization of a set of interacting individuals or units has been intensively studied because of its ubiquity in the natural world. In this Letter, we show how for fixed coupling strengths local patterns of synchronization emerge differently in homogeneous and heterogeneous complex networks, driving the process towards a certain global synchronization degree following different paths. The dependence of the dynamics on the coupling strength and on the topology is unveiled. This study provides a new perspective and tools to understand this emerging phenomena.}

We show that {ES} is, in fact, far more general and can occur in adaptive and multilayer networks in the absence of such correlation properties. We first report evidence of {ES} for single-layer networks where a fraction f of the nodes have links adaptively controlled by a local order parameter, and we then extend the study to a variety of two-layer networks with a fraction f of their nodes coupled with each other by means of dependency links. In the latter case, we give evidence of {ES} regardless of the differences in the frequency distribution, in the topology of connections between the layers, or both. Finally, we provide a rigorous, analytical treatment to properly ground all of the observed scenarios and to advance the understanding of the actual mechanisms at the basis of {ES} in real-world systems.}

abstract = {Explosive synchronization and explosive percolation are currently two independent phenomena occurring in complex networks, where the former takes place in dynamical phase space while the latter in configuration space. It has been revealed that the mechanism of {EP} can be explained by the Achlioptas process, where the formation of a giant component is controlled by a suppressive rule. We here introduce an equivalent suppressive rule for {ES}. Before the critical point of {ES}, the suppressive rule induces the presence of multiple, small sized, synchronized clusters, while inducing the abrupt formation of a giant cluster of synchronized oscillators at the critical coupling strength. We also show how the explosive character of {ES} degrades into a second-order phase transition when the suppressive rule is broken. These results suggest that our suppressive rule can be considered as a dynamical counterpart of the Achlioptas process, indicating that {ES} and {EP} can be unified into a same framework.}

The internal connection architecture of each network follows a small-world topology and the external connection scheme is based on the local mean field potential, where one network receives the signal from the other. To analyze the system, we use Kuramoto order parameter computed over each neuron data, and recurrence quantification analyses, particularly the ratio of recurrent points belonging to diagonal lines of the recurrence plot {RP} , namely the determinism, computed over the local mean field potential of the networks, an easier experimentally accessible data. We analyze the complex synchronization scenario depicted by the network as a function of internal and external coupling parameters. Particularly, we identify regions of non-monotonic dependence of the synchronization level as a function of the coupling strength; coupling induced phase desynchronization ({PD}), where the synchronization levels are similar to those expected for randomly distributed phases; almost complete spike synchronization ({\SS}) for which even spikes composing a burst are synchronized. This regime occurs as a product of the fast modulated signal imposed by the coupling between networks and weak internal coupling; finally, bursting synchronization ({BS}) regions are associated with slow modulated internal coupling.}

A star network model is set to prove this novel behavior. We also find that the degree assortativity has significant influence on the explosive synchronization but slight impact on the hierarchical synchronization.

While variations in firing rates can happen with the neuronal system maintaining its homeostatic firing pattern of tonic firing, or bursting, changes in firing rates can also be associated with transitions between the two patterns of firing. Our computer simulations suggest a possible mechanism directly related to the shortening of the duration of the action potential for higher firing rates with temperature increase. Increased temperatures also shorten the period doubling cascade and chaos transition between tonic and burting regimes. Copyright \copyright 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {The brain is perhaps the most advanced and robust computation system known. We are creating a method to study how information is processed and encoded in living cultured neuronal networks by interfacing them to a computer-generated animal, the Neurally-Controlled Animat, within a virtual world. Cortical neurons from rats are dissociated and cultured on a surface containing a grid of electrodes (multi-electrode arrays, or {MEAs}) capable of both recording and stimulating neural activity. Distributed patterns of neural activity are used to control the behavior of the Animat in a simulated environment. The computer acts as its sensory system providing electrical feedback to the network about the Animat's movement within its environment. Changes in the Animat's behavior due to interaction with its surroundings are studied in concert with the biological processes (e.g., neural plasticity) that produced those changes, to understand how information is processed and encoded within a living neural network. Thus, we have created a hybrid real-time processing engine and control system that consists of living, electronic, and simulated components. Eventually this approach may be applied to controlling robotic devices, or lead to better real-time silicon-based information processing and control algorithms that are fault tolerant and can repair themselves.}

It is observed that for noisy activation kinetics, the parameter range decomposes into two regions in which the system reacts qualitatively completely different to small perturbations through noise, and these regions are separated by a homoclinic bifurcation. Noise implemented as an additional current yields a substantially different system response at low temperature values, while the response at high temperatures is comparable to activation-kinetic noise. We elucidate how this phenomenon can be understood in terms of state space dynamics and gives quantitative results on the statistics of interspike interval distributions across the relevant parameter range.}

For the population, there was an inverse correlation between {CV} and mean rate. However, 46\% of the {INs} had task-dependent changes in regularity that were not predicted by changes in firing rate, suggesting that their firing pattern is determined not only by the intrinsic properties of the neurons but also by the properties of its synaptic inputs. {INs} showed two main response types to passive wrist displacement: biphasic and coactivation. Cells with these sensory responses had different, stereotypical temporal activity profiles and firing regularity during active movement. However, {INs} having correlational linkages with forearm muscles, identified as features in spike-triggered averages of electromyographic activity, did not exhibit unique responses or firing properties, although they tended to fire more regularly than other {INs}. This suggests the lack of a precise mapping of inputs to outputs for the spinal premotor network.}

abstract = {This paper examines how noise interacts with the non-linear dynamical mechanisms of neuronal stimulus. We study the spike trains generated by a minimal Hodgkin-Huxley type model of a cold receptor neuron. The distributions of interspike intervals({ISIs}) of purely deterministic simulations exhibit considerable differences compared to the noisy ones. We quantify the effect of noise using {ISI} return plots and the {ISI}-distance recently proposed by Kreuz et al. (J Neurosci Meth, 165:151-161, 2007). It is shown that the spike trains of a cold receptor neuron are more strongly affected by noise for low temperatures than for high temperatures. This trend is also observed in both regimes of cold receptors: tonic firing(which occurs for low and high temperatures) and bursting (which occurs for intermediate temperatures).}

abstract = {Visually induced neuronal activity in V1 displays a marked gamma-band component which is modulated by stimulus properties. It has been argued that synchronized oscillations contribute to these gamma-band activity. However, analysis of Local Field Potentials ({LFPs}) across different experiments reveals considerable diversity in the degree of oscillatory behavior of this induced activity. Contrast-dependent power enhancements can indeed occur over a broad band in the gamma frequency range and spectral peaks may not arise at all. Furthermore, even when oscillations are observed, they undergo temporal decorrelation over very few cycles. This is not easily accounted for in previous network modeling of gamma oscillations. We argue here that interactions between cortical layers can be responsible for this fast decorrelation. We study a model of a V1 hypercolumn, embedding a simplified description of the multi-layered structure of the cortex. When the stimulus contrast is low, the induced activity is only weakly synchronous and the network resonates transiently without developing collective oscillations. When the contrast is high, on the other hand, the induced activity undergoes synchronous oscillations with an irregular spatiotemporal structure expressing a synchronous chaotic state. As a consequence the population activity undergoes fast temporal decorrelation, with concomitant rapid damping of the oscillations in {LFPs} autocorrelograms and peak broadening in {LFPs} power spectra. We show that the strength of the inter-layer coupling crucially affects this spatiotemporal structure. We predict that layer {VI} inactivation should induce global changes in the spectral properties of induced {LFPs}, reflecting their slower temporal decorrelation in the absence of inter-layer feedback. Finally, we argue that the mechanism underlying the emergence of synchronous chaos in our model is in fact very general. It stems from the fact that gamma oscillations induced by local delayed inhibition tend to develop chaos when coupled by sufficiently strong excitation.}

abstract = {We investigate the synchronization features of a network of spiking neurons under a distance-dependent coupling following a power-law model. The interplay between topology and coupling strength leads to the existence of different spatiotemporal patterns, corresponding to either non-synchronized or phase-synchronized states. Particularly interesting is what we call synchronization malleability, in which the system depicts significantly different phase synchronization degrees for the same parameters as a consequence of a different ordering of neural inputs. We analyze the functional connectivity of the network by calculating the mutual information between neuronal spike trains, allowing us to characterize the structures of synchronization in the network. We show that these structures are dependent on the ordering of the inputs for the parameter regions where the network presents synchronization malleability and we suggest that this is due to a balance between local and global effects.}

abstract = {An important idea in neural information processing is the communication-through-coherence hypothesis, according to which communication between two brain regions is effective only if they are phase-locked. Also of importance is neuronal variability, a phenomenon in which a single neuron's inter-firing times may be highly variable. In this work, we aim to connect these two ideas by studying the effects of that variability on the capability of neurons to reach phase synchronization. We simulate a network of modified-Hodgkin-Huxley-bursting neurons possessing a small-world topology. First, variability is shown to be correlated with the average degree of phase synchronization of the network. Next, restricting to spatial variability - which measures the deviation of firing times between all neurons in the network - we show that it is positively correlated to a behavior we call promiscuity, which is the tendency of neurons to to have their relative phases change with time. This relation is observed in all cases we tested, regardless of the degree of synchronization or the strength of the inter-neuronal coupling: high variability implies high promiscuity (low duration of phase-locking), even if the network as a whole is synchronized and the coupling is strong. We argue that spatial variability actually generates promiscuity. Therefore, we conclude that variability has a strong influence on both the degree and the manner in which neurons phase synchronize, which is another reason for its relevance in neural communication.}

In such a state, the oscillators form quantized clusters, where neither their phases nor their instantaneous frequencies are locked. The oscillators' instantaneous speeds are different within the clusters, but they form a characteristic cusped pattern and, more importantly, they behave periodically in time so that their average values are the same. Given its intrinsic specular nature with respect to the recently introduced Chimera states, the phase is termed the Bellerophon state. We provide an analytical and numerical description of Bellerophon states, and furnish practical hints on how to seek them in a variety of experimental and natural systems.}

Multiple short-lived states of resting-state functional connectivity ({rsFC}) identified transiently synchronized networks and cross-network integration. However, little is known about the way brain couplings covary as {rsFC} states wax and wane. In this magnetoencephalography study, we explore the synchronization structure among the spontaneous interactions of well-known resting-state networks ({RSNs}). To do so, we extracted modes of dynamic coupling that reflect {rsFC} synchrony and analyzed their spatio-temporal features. These modes identified transient, sporadic {rsFC} changes characterized by the widespread integration of {RSNs} across the brain, most prominently in the \beta band. This is in line with the metastable {rsFC} state model of resting-state dynamics, wherein our modes fit as state transition processes. Furthermore, the default-mode network ({DMN}) stood out as being structured into competitive cross-network couplings with widespread {DMN}-{RSN} interactions, especially among the \beta-band modes. These results substantiate the theory that the {DMN} is a core network enabling dynamic global brain integration in the \beta band. Copyright \copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

It is shown through simulation that the metastable behaviour of the system is dependent in all cases on connection delay, and a critical region is found that maximizes indices of both metastability and the prevalence of chimera states. We show dependence of phase coherence in synchronous oscillation on the level and strength of external connectivity between communities, and demonstrate that synchronization dynamics are dependent on the modular structure of the network.

abstract = {There is strong evidence that anesthetics have stereotypical effects on brain state, so that a given anesthetic appears to have a signature in the electroencephalogram ({EEG}), which may vary with dose. This can be usefully interpreted as the anesthetic determining an attractor in the phase space of the brain. How brain activity shifts between these attractors in time remains understudied, as most studies implicitly assume a one-to-one relationship between drug dose and attractor features by assuming stationarity over the analysis interval and analyzing data segments of several minutes in length. Yet data in rats anesthetized with isoflurane suggests that, at anesthetic levels consistent with surgical anesthesia, brain activity alternates between multiple attractors, often spending on the order of 10 min in one activity pattern before shifting to another. Moreover, the probability of these jumps between attractors changes with anesthetic concentration. This suggests the hypothesis that brain state is metastable during anesthesia: though it appears at equilibrium on short timescales (on the order of seconds to a few minutes), longer intervals show shifting behavior. Compelling evidence for metastability in rats anesthetized with isoflurane is reviewed, but so far only suggestive hints of metastability in brain states exist with other anesthetics or in other species. Explicit testing of metastability during anesthesia will require experiments with longer acquisition intervals and carefully designed analytic approaches; some of the implications of these constraints are reviewed for typical spectral analysis approaches. If metastability exists during anesthesia, it implies degeneracy in the relationship between brain state and effect site concentration, as there is not a one-to-one mapping between the two. This degeneracy could explain some of the reported difficulty in using brain activity monitors to titrate drug dose to prevent awareness during anesthesia and should force a rethinking of the notion of depth of anesthesia as a single dimension. Finally, explicit incorporation of knowledge of the dynamics of the brain during anesthesia could offer better depth of anesthesia monitoring.}

Yet an ongoing paradigm shift to a dynamic network perspective is underway. This new viewpoint treats cortical function as arising from the coordination dynamics within and between cortical regions. Cortical coordination dynamics arises due to the unidirectional influences imposed on a cortical area by inputs from other areas that project to it, combined with the projection reciprocity that characterizes cortical connectivity and gives rise to reentrant processing. As a result, cortical dynamics exhibits both segregative and integrative tendencies and gives rise to both cooperative and competitive relations within and between cortical areas that are hypothesized to underlie the emergence of cognition in brains.}

abstract = {Metastability refers to the fact that the state of a dynamical system spends a large amount of time in a restricted region of its available phase space before a transition takes place, bringing the system into another state from where it might recur into the previous one. beim Graben and Hutt (2013) suggested to use the recurrence plot ({RP}) technique introduced by Eckmann et al. (1987) for the segmentation of system's trajectories into metastable states using recurrence grammars. Here, we apply this recurrence structure analysis ({RSA}) for the first time to resting-state brain dynamics obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}). Brain regions are defined according to the brain hierarchical atlas ({BHA}) developed by Diez et al. (2015), and as a consequence, regions present high-connectivity in both structure (obtained from diffusion tensor imaging) and function (from the blood-level dependent-oxygenation-{BOLD}-signal). Remarkably, regions observed by Diez et al. were completely time-invariant. Here, in order to compare this static picture with the metastable systems dynamics obtained from the {RSA} segmentation, we determine the number of metastable states as a measure of complexity for all subjects and for region numbers varying from 3 to 100. We find {RSA} convergence toward an optimal segmentation of 40 metastable states for normalized {BOLD} signals, averaged over {BHA} modules. Next, we build a bistable dynamics at population level by pooling 30 subjects after Hausdorff clustering. In link with this finding, we reflect on the different modeling frameworks that can allow for such scenarios: heteroclinic dynamics, dynamics with riddled basins of attraction, multiple-timescale dynamics. Finally, we characterize the metastable states both functionally and structurally, using templates for resting state networks ({RSNs}) and the automated anatomical labeling ({AAL}) atlas, respectively.}

abstract = {Cortical activity exhibits persistent metastable dynamics. Assemblies of neurons transiently couple (integrate) and decouple (segregate) at multiple spatiotemporal scales; both integration and segregation are required to support metastability. Integration of distant brain regions can be achieved through long range excitatory projections, but the mechanism supporting long range segregation is not clear. We argue that the thalamocortical matrix connections, which project diffusely from the thalamus to the cortex and have long been thought to support cortical gain control, play an equally-important role in cortical segregation. We present a computational model of the diffuse thalamocortical loop, called the competitive cross-coupling ({CXC}) spiking network. Simulations of the model show how different levels of tonic input from the brainstem to the thalamus could control dynamical complexity in the cortex, directing transitions between sleep, wakefulness and high attention or vigilance. The model also explains how mutually-exclusive activity could arise across large portions of the cortex, such as between the default-mode and task-positive networks. It is robust to noise but does not require noise to autonomously generate metastability. We conclude that the long range segregation observed in brain activity and required for global metastable dynamics could be provided by the thalamocortical matrix, and is strongly modulated by brainstem input to the thalamus.}
